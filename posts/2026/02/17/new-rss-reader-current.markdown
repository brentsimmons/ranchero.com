Terry Godier [announces his new RSS reader Current](https://www.terrygodier.com/current):

> The impulse was simpler than a philosophy: every RSS reader I tried made me feel bad. Not because the apps were ugly or broken (most were quite good) but because they all seemed to agree on something I didn’t. That reading the internet was a task.

The UI of Current is based on that premise — and it joins a small but awesome number of RSS readers that are doing something besides the usual (see [Tapestry](https://usetapestry.com/) and [Feedland](https://feedland.org/) for other great examples).

Because RSS is an open protocol, and because there are so many different possible ways to follow and read the news, RSS readers ought to be a UI playground in the way Twitter clients once were, where innovation and experimentation are normal and celebrated.

From the author of one of the oldest RSS readers to the author of one of the newest: Cheers! And thank you, and keep making things new.
