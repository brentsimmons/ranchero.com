[FeedCity](https://feed.city/) by Daniel Pietzsch says that it’s “Your feed reader for a stress-free way to follow websites. Encouraging exploration and sharing.”

In the [launch announcement](https://danielpietzsch.com/articles/feedcity) from May 2025, Daniel writes:

This is more evidence that we’re seeing growth in number of RSS readers and we’re seeing different approaches and different emphases. This one is not just no-unread-counts but also *social*, with outbound RSS. Very cool!
