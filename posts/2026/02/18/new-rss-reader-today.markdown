Jake Spurlock writes of his new RSS reader in [Today Comes to the Mac](https://jakespurlock.com/2026/02/today-comes-to-the-mac/):

> Today on Mac uses a three-column layout: your feeds in the sidebar, articles in the middle, and the full article on the right. It’s the kind of layout that just makes sense when you have the screen real estate, and it makes triaging a busy morning of feeds feel effortless.

I note that it includes (local) AI summaries of articles, which is a feature we don’t have in NetNewsWire. It’s an interesting one — some people are very eager to see us add that feature, and there are other people who would abandon the app entirely the second we add any AI feature, no matter if optional and unobtrusive.

But that’s a side note — Today looks very cool! Congratulations to Jake on shipping the Mac app!
