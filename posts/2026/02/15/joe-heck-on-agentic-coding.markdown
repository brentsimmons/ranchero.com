> The latest “frontier” models are north of 1.2 trillion parameters today, maybe bigger… Even with the breadth of data, it can *only* predict patterns that it’s seen before. The generalization jump at 100 billion parameters means that it can start to apply patterns it’s seen in one place to another, but it still has to have seen it somewhere.

Joe’s explanations and details are good and helpful to me — there’s so much I don’t know. But I think we all need to know and understand this stuff, whether we’re LLM users or not.

It is deeply annoying that this is such a huge topic right now. There’s a ton of other stuff going on and I don’t want to have to deal with this too. But we don’t have a choice.
