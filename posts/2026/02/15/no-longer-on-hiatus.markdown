Sure, it’s been a while, but why not bring back the ol’ linkblog. 🐣🐥

I gave it a design very much inspired by what it used to [look like in the mid-2000s](https://web.archive.org/web/20051231074445/http://ranchero.com/) — the idea was to make it look like I just started posting to it again. Easy as that.

The new/old design uses gradients. And Verdana! Love Verdana.
