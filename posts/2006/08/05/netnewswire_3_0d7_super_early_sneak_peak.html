See inessential.com for a <a href="http://inessential.com/?comments=1&amp;postid=3343">super-early sneak peek release</a> of NetNewsWire 3.0. It’s not even a beta yet—it’s definitely a work in progress, with a bunch of features and bug fixes still to come. But it has a rewritten Combined View that is very much an improvement over the old one. (NetNewsWire 3.0 will be a free upgrade.)
