<a href="http://www.unsanity.org/archives/rant/caring_for_developers.php">Rosyna</a>: “The far majority of them are very nice, helpful, and all-around good people. Although there are a few that constantly curse. Almost as if every other word is a curse word. It’s not directed at anyone so there’s no need to be personally offended. It’s just that they’ve likely been dealing with C++ for so long that they don’t even realize they are cursing at all.” (Via <a href="http://www.rhonabwy.com/wp/2006/08/02/developer-rant-from-rosyna/">Rhonabwy</a>.)
