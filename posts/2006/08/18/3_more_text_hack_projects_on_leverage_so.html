<a href="http://michael-mccracken.net/wp/?p=61">Michael-McCracken.net</a>: “13 months ago, I ‘launched’ the leverage project on sourceforge, supposed to be a place to house all the various OS X / Cocoa text manipulation hacks I’ve done, including my I-Search for NSTextView InputManager hack... today I added three more projects to the SVN repository with varying appeal and usability.”
