I got email from David Dunham that the <a href="http://a-sharp.com/opal/">Opal pre-release</a> is now feature-complete: “It has essentially the same easy-to-use feature set as Acta, but adds multiple selection, a search field, on-screen magnification, the ability to focus on a subset of the outline, and Spotlight support.”</p>

<p>David’s a fellow Seattle-ite, by the way.
