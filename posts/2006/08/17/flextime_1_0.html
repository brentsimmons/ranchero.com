<a href="http://www.red-sweater.com/blog/171/flextime-10">Red Sweater Blog</a>: “I put FlexTime in the ‘cold-storage locker’ one week ago yesterday and it’s been resting up for its official 1.0 debut. FlexTime 1.0 is available starting today for $18.95.”</p>

<p>One of these days Daniel and I will have to fight (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cage_match">cage match</a>?) over the prefix RS for our Cocoa code.  ;) (Sure, I still use RS, since I always have—don’t <i>even</i> make me point out that Apple still uses NS instead of AC. [Actually, for app-specific classes I often use the app’s initials, NNW or ME.] But, enough of that—check out FlexTime.)
