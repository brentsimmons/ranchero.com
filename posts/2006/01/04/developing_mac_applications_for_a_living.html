Michael Dupuis: <a href="http://www.michaeldupuis.com/TheSoftwareUnderground/2006/01/developing-mac-applications-for-living.html">My Own Take on Getting to Live “The Life”</a>: “With two applications now, I was starting to take the idea of doing my Mac development full time. I had essentially been working 2 full-time jobs for a long time, and it was starting to take its toll. Something had to give.”
