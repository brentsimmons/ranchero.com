<a href="http://developer.apple.com/dtkexchange/">Apple Developer Connection</a>: “Each Developer Transition Kit you have may be exchanged for a new Intel-based iMac at no charge. We’ll provide you with the iMac prior to your return of the DTK to allow you to move resources as necessary from the DTK to the iMac.”</p>

<p>This DTK-renting developer has this to say: “Hey, cool!”
