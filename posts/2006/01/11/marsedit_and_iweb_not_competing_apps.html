On <a href="http://inessential.com/?comments=1&amp;postid=3246">inessential.com</a>, Brent explains the differences between MarsEdit and iWeb. Though both can be used as part of a blogging workflow, they’re different in intent and purpose: MarsEdit is an editor that works with weblog generators such as TypePad, Blogger, and WordPress, while iWeb is an editor that is <i>also</i> a weblog generator.
