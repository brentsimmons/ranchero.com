<a href="http://www.rassoc.com/gregr/weblog/archive.aspx?post=793">Greg Reinacker</a>: “I’m a visual person, and a lot of the feeds I subscribe to have images in the posts. If I could see all of those images together, I could make some quick decisions about what I want to read now, vs. what I will read later.&#160;And thus was born the image aggregator.”
