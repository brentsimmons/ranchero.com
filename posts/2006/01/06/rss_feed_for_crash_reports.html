<a href="http://kevin.sb.org/articles/2006/01/05/rss-feed-for-crash-reports">Kevin Ballard</a>: “I wrote a ruby script that generates an RSS feed for all the Crash Reporter logs on your machine. Just create a New Special Subscription in NetNewsWire, point it at the script, and you’re all set.” We might add that it’s extra cool because it uses red text for the thread that crashed, making it easy to pick out. (And we’ll also remind you to make sure the script is executable so that NetNewsWire can run it.)
