Buzz Andersen: <a href="http://weblog.scifihifi.com/2006/07/23/party-time-excellent/">Party Time, Excellent</a>: “As I mentioned before, this year I had far more ambitious plans for the party than in previous years, so the planning has been much more logistically challenging. Fortunately, all the ducks are now in a row, so I can finally fill you all in on the details.”
