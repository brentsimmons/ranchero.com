<a href="http://ironcoder.org/blog/2006/06/16/next-ironcoder-july-21-23/">ironcoder.org</a>: “The next ironcoder contest will be July 21-23, and we’re going to do it a little differently this time. You’ll get the API and theme at the same time—giving you a full 48 hours to work on your project. (That’s an extra 100% for the same price!).”
