<a href="http://daringfireball.net/2006/07/mr_jimmy">Daring Fireball</a>: “Mac OS X is a very hackable platform; it just isn’t hackable by means of the raw source code to the software. This is one area where Mac OS X inherits good aspects from both sides of its family. From the classic Mac OS, it inherits AppleScript and a tradition of rich plug-in APIs for major applications. From Next, it inherits both the entire (highly scriptable) Unix layer and the eminently hackable and modular Objective-C runtime system.”
