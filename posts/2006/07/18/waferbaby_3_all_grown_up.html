Daniel “Eagle-Eye” Bogan has open-sourced <a href="http://waferbaby.com/archives/2006/07/18/all_grown_up">waferbaby</a>: “I must admit, it’s been hard watching you grow up sometimes, knowing that one day soon you’d become your own little independent unit, and leave the comfort of the nest we’ve built together over all these years.” (Via <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2006/july#tue-18-waferbaby">Daring Fireball</a>.)
