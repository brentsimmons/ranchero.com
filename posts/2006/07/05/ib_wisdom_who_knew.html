<a href="http://scrap.dasgenie.com/articles/2006/07/05/ib-wisdom-who-knew">DasGenie:!Scrap</a>: “Here I am, 3 years developing cocoa applications and working with Interface builder. And always I hated the fact that I had to resize all the interface elements when I wanted a different default window size. Little did I know that you actually can resize a window in IB with all the subviews autoresizing.”
