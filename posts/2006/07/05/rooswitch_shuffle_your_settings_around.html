<a href="http://roobasoft.com/rooSwitch/">roobasoft</a>: “rooSwitch exists to make it easy for you to create different profiles of almost any applications data. You then switch amongst the profiles to activate the data you wish to use. It’s like a multi-user environment for just one application.”</p>

<p>I don’t know how many times I’ve thought of writing some scripts for this, but then didn’t—I think I’ll give rooSwitch a try.
