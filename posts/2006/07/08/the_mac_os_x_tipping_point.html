<a href="http://daringfireball.net/2006/07/mac_os_x_tipping_point">Daring Fireball</a>: “The Mac users of today are, by and large, the Mac users of 10 years ago. If you drew a Venn diagram with a circle representing Mac users circa 1996 and another circle representing Mac users circa 2006, the two circles would be about the same size and would significantly overlap.”
