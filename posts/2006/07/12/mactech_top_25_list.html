<a href="http://www.mactech.com/news/?p=1008582">MacTech Magazine</a>: “MacTech Magazine today announced the MacTech 25: The Mac technical community’s most influential people.”</p>

<p>Apple employees and MacTech staff weren’t eligible, and voting was public, which makes this quite different from the <a href="http://www.macworld.co.uk/news/index.cfm?home&amp;NewsID=15156">MDJ Power 25</a>. Though a few of the same names appear (including mine ;), the MacTech list looks like it has more developers and bloggers. Names include such rock stars as Jonathan “Wolf” Rentzsch, Drunkenbatman, John Gruber, Aaron Hillegas, John Siracusa, and plenty more.</p>

<p>(Okay, the name <i>Drunkenbatman</i> still cracks me up, especially to see it played straight on a list like this. Love it.)
