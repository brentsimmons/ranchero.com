<a href="http://caseapps.com/sofacontrol.html">CASE Apps</a>: “Apple ships a Remote Control with any new Mac. The pre-installed functionality is limited to control just a couple of applications. Sofa Control breaks this limit. With Sofa Control you are able to control any application on your Mac and trigger the actions you like.”</p>

<p>Sofa Control comes with built-in support for NetNewsWire—you can control NetNewsWire with your Apple Remote Control.
