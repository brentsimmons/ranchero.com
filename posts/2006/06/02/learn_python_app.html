<a href="http://www.red-sweater.com/blog/140/learn-python">Red Sweater Blog</a>: “Learn Python is a simple Mac OS X application (GNU License, source included) that puts a web browser and terminal window into one application. The web browser points at the aforementioned Python tutorial on the web, and it remembers the last URL you went to, so you can trust it to remember which chapter you were at when you last quit.”
