<a href="http://www.rogueamoeba.com/utm/posts/Article/Lessons-Learned-2006-06-08-13-00">Rogue Amoeba</a>: “Just under a month ago we released our very first Windows product, Airfoil for Windows, and it’s doing well. We received a lot of interest relating to our decision to develop for Windows, ranging from a desire to hear our thoughts on developing to questions on sales numbers and comparisons between the Mac and Windows worlds. In this article, I’ll be speaking about the marketing and sales end of the experience of expanding from the Mac to Windows.”
