<a href="http://nick.typepad.com/blog/2006/02/feeddemon_20_ea.html">Nick Bradbury</a>: “I had hoped to get beta 2 of FeedDemon 2.0 out this week, but unfortunately we’ve had to delay it for a few days. To make up for this, I’ll spill the beans about the Easter egg that’s in the first FeedDemon 2.0 beta.”
