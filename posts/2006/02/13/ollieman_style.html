<a href="http://www.ollieman.net/words/2006/02/selftitled_newsreader_style.php">ollieman</a>: “And so I present to you, the oven-fresh new style: ollieman. It’s fitting that this style be self-titled; I feel that this new design is the truest expression of my design-style to date. It’s the first time I have really expressed something thru code, and I’m happy to share it with you.”
