<a href="http://blog.seattlepi.nwsource.com/buzz/archives/101715.asp?source=rss">SeattlePI.com Buzzworthy</a>: “Someone has assembled a hilarious, dead-on parody video showing what one of Apple’s sleek, minimalist iPod boxes might look like if it were redesigned by Microsoft.”</p>

<p><i>Update noon-ish Thursday:</i> here’s a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeXAcwriid0&amp;search=microsoft%20ipod">new URL</a> for the video. (The old one was apparently taken down.) (Thanks, Ronnie! Thanks, Jack!)
