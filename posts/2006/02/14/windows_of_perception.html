<a href="http://www.red-sweater.com/blog/97/windows-of-perception">Daniel Jalkut</a>: “An average user looking at their desktop, with all Finder windows closed, would answer ‘none’ to the question ‘how many windows are open?’ But there are dozens if not hundreds of windows being displayed in part or full on a typical Mac user’s screen. They just don’t look like windows.” (Via <a href="http://mjtsai.com/blog/">Michael Tsai</a>.)
