<a href="http://db.tidbits.com/getbits.acgi?tbart=08411">TidBITS</a>: “Thanks to Path Finder 4, from Cocoatech, you can bypass the Finder in favor of a sensible, rational, gorgeously clean environment for working with files and folders. At every step, in every detail, Path Finder’s interface and behavior simply do the Right Thing.”
