<a href="http://www.rhonabwy.com/mt/archives/2006_01.html#002826">Rhonabwy</a>: “The development tools are good, but frankly the most amazing development benefits are in the CHUD tools—there’s stuff that is thousands of dollars worth of software in there, and they’re just handing it to you. I’d even bet that if you developed for Linux, you’d find Shark a hell of a benefit to you.”
