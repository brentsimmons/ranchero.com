<a href="http://www.rassoc.com/gregr/weblog/archive.aspx?post=802">Greg Reinacker</a>: “Other than the first week after we buy a new phone or PDA, when we play with absolutely everything, most of us use mobile devices as an extension of our everyday lives. It’s not the only device we use—it’s a companion device that we use when we’re not sitting at our desk, or with our laptop on.”
