<a href="http://www.hawkwings.net/2006/03/28/the-talking-mailapp-series/">Hawk Wings</a>: “I’ve finally given up all hope that Steve Jobs will ever answer my emails, so it’s time to close off the ‘Talking Mail.app’ series that ran on Hawk Wings through February and early March.”</p>

<p>I enjoyed reading these (even though I don’t use Mail much). Tim deserves a round of applause for putting this together. Very cool.
