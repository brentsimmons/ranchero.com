<a href="http://nick.typepad.com/blog/2006/03/feeddemon_20_is.html">Nick Bradbury</a>: “After months of coding, debugging, refining and performance-tuning, FeedDemon 2.0 is finally done. The code has been frozen, the final install has been built, the documentation has been written, and we’re all set to go live with it.”</p>

<p>Congratulations to Nick!
