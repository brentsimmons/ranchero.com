We have found some bugs in the NetNewsWire 2.1 beta just released today. Which is completely expected, and just proves that it’s a beta.</p>

<p>Here are the two main ones, just so you know we know about them...</p>

<p>The first is that it doesn’t run on 10.3.9. It <i>was</i> working on 10.3.9, but a recent change stopped it from working. We’ll get it fixed for the next release.</p>

<p>The second is that, for some people, they can’t refresh at all. (We have a lead on the cause, but we’re not positive yet of the fix.)</p>

<p>We’re working on both bugs, of course, and there will be new betas.
