<a href="http://fraserspeirs.livejournal.com/1014447.html">Fraser Speirs</a>: “Also, a couple of scripts there for taking the front tab in Safari or the selected headline in NetNewsWire, archiving and flagging it in Yojimbo. Nice for when you hit an item you want to read in-depth but not immediately, or you’re trying to rapidly accumulate research material on a particular topic.”
