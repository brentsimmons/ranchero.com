<a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/buy.php"><img src="http://ranchero.com/images/nnw/netnewswireIconlarge.png" alt="NetNewsWire Icon" align="right" width="128" height="128" border="0" hspace="4" /></a><b>Special sale!</b> You can <a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/buy.php">buy NetNewsWire for $19.95</a> from right now until NetNewsWire 2.1 ships.</p>

<p>Or you can buy the NetNewsWire/MarsEdit bundle for just $29.95, which is an even better deal.</p>

<p>This sale means you save $5 on NetNewsWire, or save $10 on the NetNewsWire/MarsEdit bundle price—$20 less than if you bought them separately at regular price.</p>

<p>If you’re a NetNewsWire Lite user, this is a great time to upgrade.</p>

<p>If you’re curious about what’s in the full version that’s not in Lite, the list looks like this: searching, browsing, persistence, smart lists, flagged items, tag subscriptions, widescreen view, scriptability, HTML differences, podcast downloading, and, well, <a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/fullversionfeatures.php">more</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/buy.php">Go to our online store</a> to buy NetNewsWire or the NetNewsWire/MarsEdit bundle.</p>

<p>When NetNewsWire 2.1 ships, the price for NetNewsWire will be $29.95, and purchasers will get a one-year NewsGator Online subscription along with all NetNewsWire updates for one year. (NetNewsWire will continue to work if the subscription lapses, though in stand-alone mode.)</p>

<p>Existing users—people who already bought NetNewsWire or <i>who buy NetNewsWire through this sale</i>—will get a two-year NewsGator Online subscription for free, as well as all NetNewsWire updates for two years. (And, again, the software doesn’t stop working if the subscription lapses: you’ve bought the software.)</p>

<p>MarsEdit will remain $24.95. There will no longer be a special NetNewsWire/MarsEdit bundle price.</p>

<p>Which is all to say: this sale is a good deal, and it ends when NetNewsWire 2.1 ships (within the next few weeks). So please <a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/buy.php">take advantage of it now</a>!</p>

<p>If you don’t already have a copy of NetNewsWire, you can download it from the <a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/">NetNewsWire home page</a>—or check out the <a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/beta.php">latest beta</a> of NetNewsWire 2.1.
