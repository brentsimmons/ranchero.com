On <a href="http://inessential.com/?comments=1&amp;postid=3259">inessential.com</a>, Brent talks about NetNewsWire 2.1. Currently in private beta testing, the next version will include NewsGator syncing, performance enhancements and bug fixes, some small new (and often-requested) features, and will of course be a Universal binary.
