Video tutorial from <a href="http://developer.apple.com/cocoa/coredatatutorial/index.html">Apple Developer Connection</a>: “When you take advantage of Core Data, it slashes the amount of custom code you need to write in order to manage application data. Opening, saving and undo management can all be handled by Core Data, freeing you to concentrate on creating unique features for your application.”</p>
