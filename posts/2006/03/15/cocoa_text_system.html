<a href="http://hcs.harvard.edu/~jrus/Site/Cocoa%20Text%20System.html">Jacob Rus</a>: “Apple’s Cocoa text system is a complicated beast, but also extremely flexible, and with a bit of work, it can be molded to match many working styles. This how-to covers the 2 major ways of customizing the text input system: Default key bindings, and for still more control, input managers.”
