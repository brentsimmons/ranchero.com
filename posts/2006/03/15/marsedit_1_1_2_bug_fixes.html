<p>This release includes a new backup feature: before sending a post to the server, a plain text version of the post is written to disk. From time to time we’ve seen a server report that all is well—when really the server lost the post. This gives you a way to get back your work in case the server reports, wrongly, that all is well.</p>

<p>Other changes include bug fixes, especially for Blogger and Blosxom weblogs.</p>
