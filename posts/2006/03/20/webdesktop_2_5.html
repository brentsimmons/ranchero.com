<a href="http://stevenf.com/mt/2006/03/webdesktop_25.php">Steven Frank</a>: “WebDesktop is a little program I wrote years ago that layers a transparent web browser window over your desktop. You can set it to your favorite news site, and let it auto-update in the background. It doesn’t get in the way of your desktop icons or other windows.” Now universal (plus other goodness).
