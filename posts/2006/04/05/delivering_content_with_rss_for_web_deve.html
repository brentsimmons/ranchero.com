<a href="http://developer.apple.com/internet/deliveringcontentwithrss.html">Apple Developer Connection</a>: “RSS, or Really Simple Syndication, is revolutionizing the delivery of web content. RSS is an XML (eXtensible Markup Language) format for coordinating the delivery of time-based content streams, or ‘feeds.’ This means that RSS can be used to deliver content that changes over time. RSS provides for the inclusion of additional data, similar to email attachments, using the &lt;enclosure&gt; tag.”
