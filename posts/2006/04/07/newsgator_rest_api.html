<a href="http://www.rassoc.com/gregr/weblog/archive.aspx?post=805">Greg Reinacker</a>: “We now have both SOAP and REST versions of the NewsGator Online API available.&#160;The SOAP version has been around for a while, and is used by our own products.&#160;The REST version is brand new, is documented here, and enters a public beta today.”</p>

<p>NetNewsWire uses the NewsGator Online API (of course)—it uses some SOAP calls and some REST calls. (I’d convert entirely to using the REST version, stop using SOAP entirely, were it not for the fact that you don’t fix what ain’t broke.)
