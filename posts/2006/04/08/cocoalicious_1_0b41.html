<a href="http://weblog.scifihifi.com/2006/04/08/cocoalicious-10b41-private-bookmarks-universal-binary/">Buzz Andersen</a>: “I finally got around to producing a Cocoalicious Universal Binary release (b41) this week. This version also has support for del.icio.us’ long awaited private bookmarking feature (if you check the ‘private’ box while posting, Cocoalicious marks the post in its own local cache as private and flags it as private when uploading to del.icio.us).”
