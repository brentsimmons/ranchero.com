<a href="http://davidweiss.blogspot.com/2006/04/tour-of-microsofts-mac-lab.html">David Weiss</a>: “Often when we have press events or special visits from our MVPs I’ll give them a tour of the Mac Lab and explain what we do. They’ve always found it very interesting and so I thought I’d share a virtual tour of our Mac Lab.”
