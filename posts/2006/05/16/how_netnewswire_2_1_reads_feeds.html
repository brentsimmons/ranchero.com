On inessential.com I write about <a href="http://inessential.com/?comments=1&amp;postid=3307">how NetNewsWire 2.1 reads feeds</a>. The short answer: if you use NewsGator syncing, it downloads feeds from NewsGator. If you don’t use syncing, it downloads feeds from the original sources, just like always. You choose.</p>

<p>But of course I go into more detail. (Plenty more! I may be in a long-winded mood.)
