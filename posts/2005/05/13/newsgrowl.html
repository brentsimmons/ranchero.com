<a href="http://fever606.distantblue.net/code/">Ian Lloyd</a>: “NewsGrowl is a script for NetNewsWire 2 that displays a count of unread headlines via Growl. It scans NetNewsWire for groups and top-level subscriptions (subscriptions that are not in any group), which are then listed in the Growl Preference Pane.”
