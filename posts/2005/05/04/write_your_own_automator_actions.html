<a href="http://www.macdevcenter.com/pub/a/mac/2005/05/03/automator.html">MacDevCenter.com, Matt Neuburg</a>: “An Automator Action is extremely easy to write. Documentation on how to do so is copious and helpful... Still, all that documentation may seem overwhelming at first, so this article presents a simple hands-on example to get you started down the road to writing your own Actions.”
