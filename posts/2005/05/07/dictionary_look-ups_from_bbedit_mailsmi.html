<a href="http://daringfireball.net/2005/05/dictionary_bbedit">Daring Fireball</a>: “To be truly useful as a writing aid, you need to be able to invoke your dictionary easily from the app in which you’re writing. What I want to do is select a word in BBEdit (or Mailsmith or TextWrangler) and tell Dictionary to look up that word in one quick action.”
