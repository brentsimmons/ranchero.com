<a href="http://blog.x180.net/2005/05/tiger_performan.html">James Duncan Davidson</a>: “There are some specific performance updates, however, that are very noticeable. One of the biggest is in the Terminal. The speed improvements in the text rendering subsystems really shows itself here. Dump lots of text to a Terminal window and it just screams by in comparison with Terminal on Panther.”
