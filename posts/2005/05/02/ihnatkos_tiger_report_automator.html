<a href="http://www.themacobserver.com/columns/ihnatko/2005/20050429automator.shtml">Andy Ihnatko</a>: “I have to admit that I was a little bit wary when Automator was first announced. On my bandolier of Geek Scout merit badges, no patch receives higher prominence than AppleScript. I don’t just write little scripts to automatically copy files to my iPod. I write full-blown applications with it.”
