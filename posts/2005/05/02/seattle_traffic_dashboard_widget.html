<a href="http://www.rhonabwy.com/mt/archives/2005_05.html#002526">Rhonabwy</a>: “It’s completely unfancy, and doesn’t do half the nice things you’d expect a proper ‘widget’ to do really, but it’s there and available for those of us in Seattle who want to see how the traffic is doing on the bridges.”
