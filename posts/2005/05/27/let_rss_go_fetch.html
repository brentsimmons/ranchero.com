<a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1064487,00.html">TIME Magazine</a>: “RSS allows you to play news editor and zero in on the information you really need, even as you expand the number of sites you sample. You can subscribe to just the parts of the Seattle Times, for example, that cover biotech and the Mariners.”
