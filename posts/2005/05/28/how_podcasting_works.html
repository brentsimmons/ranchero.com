<a href="http://ruk.ca/article/2802">Peter Rukavina</a>: “I’ve been doing a lot of talking about <i>podcasting</i> recently: explaining to people what it is, and how they can do it, and how they can listen, and how it works. I thought it might be useful to provide a very simple step by step illustration of how to ‘subscribe to a podcast.’”
