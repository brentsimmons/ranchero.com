<a href="http://blog.x180.net/2005/03/its_a_multi_lan.html">James Duncan Davidson</a>: “I’ve heard rants before about how Java is the best damn language out there and that every piece of functionality should be implemented in Java. And I’ve heard the rants taken further and say that the one thing that Company A (or B or C, but usually A) to make themselves more appealing to developers is drop everything else but Java.”
