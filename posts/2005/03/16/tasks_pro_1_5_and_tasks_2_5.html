<a href="http://www.alexking.org/blog/2005/03/07/tasks-pro-15-and-tasks-25/">alexking.org</a>: “The new features added in 1.5/2.5 are partly from the original planned evolution for the products, but were also shaped by the wonderful feedback I’ve received over the last year.” New features include recurring tasks, task templates, favorites, new themes, and more.
