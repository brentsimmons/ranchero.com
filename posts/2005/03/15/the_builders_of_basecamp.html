O&#039;Reilly Network <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/network/2005/03/10/basecamp.html">interviews Jason Fried of 37signals</a>: “We built Basecamp because we needed it. I’m a big believer in investing in what you know and what you need. We invested our time, energy, and focus into building a product that we knew we needed to run our own business. When you build what you know, and when you use what you build, you’ve got a head start on delivering a breakout product.”
