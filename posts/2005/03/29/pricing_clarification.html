This is just to clear up some confusion about pricing that people have...</p>

<p>NetNewsWire 2.0 (in beta at the time of this writing) is $24.95. Once it ships, it will still be $24.95—this is its normal price.</p>

<p>MarsEdit is a separate product: it also costs $24.95.</p>

<p>You can buy NetNewsWire and MarsEdit together for $39.95, which saves about $10.</p>

<p>To be clear:</p>

<p><pre>
NetNewsWire 2.0..............$24.95
MarsEdit 1.0.................$24.95
NetNewsWire/MarsEdit bundle..$39.95
</pre></p>

<p>(NetNewsWire 1.0.8, which is still for sale for now, costs $39.95. I think that’s where the confusion comes from. The older version of NetNewsWire costs more because it includes a weblog editor as well as the aggregator.)</p>
