You can search for feeds by name in the Sites Drawer. Here’s how:</p>

<p>1. Open the Sites Drawer if it’s not open already: choose <span class="menuPath">View > Show Sites Drawer</span>.</p>

<p>2. Click on a group or feed in the Sites Drawer.</p>

<p>3. Type cmd-F to bring up the Find panel.</p>

<p>4. Type something you want to search for—cnn, for instance—to find the first feed with a name that contain what you typed. The searching is case-insensitive, so cnn matches CNN.</p>

<p>5. Click Next to find the next feed.</p>

<p>P.S. This same thing works in the Subscriptions list.
