You can tell NetNewsWire to open tabs in the background. Here’s how:</p>

<p>1. Open the Preferences window—choose <span class="menuPath">NetNewsWire > Preferences...</span></p>

<p>2. Click on the <span class="uiname">Browsing</span> icon.</p>

<p>3. Uncheck the box next to <span class="uiname">Select new tabs as they are created</span>. (This is the same wording Safari uses, by the way.)</p>

<p>Now when you open a page in a tab, NetNewsWire won’t select the tab. Many people like to read through their news, opening tabs as they go, and then go through the tabs that they opened.
