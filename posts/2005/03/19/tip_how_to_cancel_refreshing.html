When NetNewsWire is downloading feeds, and you want to cancel downloading—type cmd-period.</p>

<p>Another way to cancel the refresh session is to open the Activity Window—which you can do by clicking on the progress indicator in the bottom left of the main window—and click the <span class="uiname">Cancel All</span> button. You can also cancel individual feed refreshes in the Activity Window.
