To find a particular subscription in the subscriptions list, here’s what to do:</p>

<p>1. Click anywhere in the subscriptions list.</p>

<p>2. Type cmd-F to bring up the Find panel.</p>

<p>3. Type part of the name of the subscription you want to find.</p>

<p>4. Hit return.</p>

<p>This will select the first matching subscription. (NetNewsWire will expand groups as needed.) Hit return again to go to the next matching subscription, if the first one wasn’t the one you were looking for. Continue until you find it.</p>

<p>The search is not case-sensitive, so “mac” will match “MaC” and so on.
