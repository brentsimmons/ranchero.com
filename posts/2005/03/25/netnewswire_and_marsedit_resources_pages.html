A type of question we often get asked is “Where can I find more styles for NetNewsWire?” or “Where can I find more scripts for MarsEdit?”</p>

<p>To answer these questions, we set up some web pages—and feeds, of course—for NetNewsWire and MarsEdit. Each application has an All category that gets everything, or you can subscribe to one or more categories: tips, scripts, and so on.</p>

<p>Here is the <a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/resources/">NetNewsWire Resources</a> page and here is <a href="http://ranchero.com/marsedit/resources/">MarsEdit Resources</a>.</p>

<p>Since these feeds also have web pages, next time someone asks where they can find more styles for NetNewsWire, we’ll be able to point them <a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/resources/styles.php">here</a>. (The web pages, as well as the feeds, are linked to from the above Resources pages.)
