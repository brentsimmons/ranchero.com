<a href="http://blog.x180.net/2005/02/cocoa_and_the_e.html">James Duncan Davidson</a>: “The story of Cocoa isn’t, at least not yet, about IT development where you can get a job in a big company. And it’s not yet about getting a job at a software house where the big applications are developed... Instead, the story of Cocoa is about the small software shop where people are busting out incredible software with small teams.”
