<a href="http://www.macworld.com/news/2005/02/16/transmit3/index.php?lsrc=mcrss-0205">MacCentral</a>: “Transmit 3 adds new features, including a column view, tabs for multiple connections, a ‘sidebar’ reminiscent of the Finder, a redesigned Favorites feature, new preview drawer and much more, including full iDisk and WebDAV support that Panic claims is faster than the Finder.”
