Flying Meat’s <a href="http://www.flyingmeat.com/flysketch/">FlySketch</a> works like this: “When called upon, FlySketch will show its main drawing window above all other windows in the system. Change the transparency of the canvas, and you can trace, draw over, highlight, and capture just about anything that shows up behind FlySketch.”
