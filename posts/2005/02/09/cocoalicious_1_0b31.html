<a href="http://www.scifihifi.com/weblog/software/Cocoalicious-1.0b31.html">Buzz</a>: “Superbowl Sunday probably wasn’t the best day to do it, since most people were clearly preoccupied, but on Sunday I finally released Cocoalicious 1.0b31. This release took what seemed like forever, mainly because we were trying to get a very involved feature ready for prime time: full text indexing and search of bookmarked pages.”
