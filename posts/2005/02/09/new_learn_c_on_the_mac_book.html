MacCentral: <a href="http://www.macworld.com/news/2005/02/09/learnc/index.php?lsrc=mcrss-0205">Mark’s ‘Learn C on the Mac’ updated for OS X</a>: “SpiderWorks LLC on Wednesday announced the publication of an e-book version of Dave Mark’s seminal ‘Learn C on the Macintosh,’ now updated for Mac OS X.”</p>

<p>We at Ranchero learned C from an earlier version of Learn C on the Macintosh. (In fact, we have a small collection of well-thumbed Dave Mark books.)
