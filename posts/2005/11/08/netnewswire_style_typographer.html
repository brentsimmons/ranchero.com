<a href="http://ollieman.net/?page_id=56">Oliver Taylor</a>: “Typographer is a clean, minimalist theme that focuses on beautiful, readable text. The header font is ‘Hoefler Text,’ a wonderful typeface, and uses Baskerville as a body text. Instead of mimicking the look of a book, I decided to attempt to mimic the feel of an old book.”
