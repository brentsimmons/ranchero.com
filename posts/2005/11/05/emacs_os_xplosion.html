<a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2005/11/05/OS-X-Emacs">ongoing</a>: “OS X has been with us for a few years now, and Emacs has been coming along slowly and surely. We must have hit some sort of a tipping point, and there are a whole lot of people working on the problem; the result is that life is getting better and better for the Emacs tribe.”
