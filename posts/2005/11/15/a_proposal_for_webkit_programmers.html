<a href="http://www.karelia.com/sandvox/a_proposal_for_webkit_programmers.html">Karelia Software</a>: “So here is our offer: for each bug from our list (below) that is fixed (via a patch attached to the report in the WebKit Bugzilla), to our satisfaction, we will pay a ‘fix thank you’ of US$100. If and when a submitted patch is committed to the official WebKit repository, we will pay that person a ‘committed patch thank you’ of US$150.”
