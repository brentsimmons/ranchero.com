<a href="http://www.cocoaradio.com/2005/11/cocoaradio_inte.html">CocoaRadio</a>: “In this podcast, Rory Prior of ThinkMac Software in the U.K. talks about coming to the Mac from Java among other learning experiences. While his application, NewsMac, was one of the first RSS news readers on the Mac it’s only fairly recently that he’s joined the ranks of Cocoa developers. He also offers some advice to operating a Mac software business from the U.K.”
