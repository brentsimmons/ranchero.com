<a href="http://www.niallkennedy.com/blog/archives/2005/11/simple_sharing.html">Niall Kennedy</a>: “I created a Simple Sharing Extensions exporter for NetNewsWire followed links as a proof of concept. The OPML SSE exporter is written in AppleScript. It iterates through each subscription feed and its items, outputting every feed and the descriptive data about the items you have opened in a browser.”
