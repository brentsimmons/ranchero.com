The folks at Big Nerd Ranch have started a <a href="http://weblog.bignerdranch.com/">weblog</a>: “We will be talking about the stuff we consult and teach classes on: Cocoa, PHP, PostgreSQL, System Administration.”</p>

<p>Rich Siegel (BBEdit fame) started <a href="http://www.glorifiedtypist.com/">Glorified Typist</a> about a month ago, where he “writes about whatever he wants to.”</p>

<p>(Both weblogs have RSS feeds, of course.)
