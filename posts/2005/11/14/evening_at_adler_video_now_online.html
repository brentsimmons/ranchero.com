<a href="http://www.drunkenblog.com/evening_at_adler/">drunkenblog</a>: “On October 21st in the year of &#039;05, ten top Mac developers (primarily indies) from around the USA were invited to the Adler Planetarium in Chicago, IL for an evening of conversation around a broad range of topics: Making a living writing for the Mac, software patents, competing with Apple, digital rights management (DRM), software activation, bugs, Ajax, unit testing, building communities, the x86 transition, and much much more... This was recorded, and the video and audio are now online.”
