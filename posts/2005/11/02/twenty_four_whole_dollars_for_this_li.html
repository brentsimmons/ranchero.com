<a href="http://www.rogueamoeba.com/utm/posts/Article/Standards-2005-11-01-10-00.html">Rogue Amoeba</a>: “In the past six months, we’ve had three different magazines contact us and ask if we would be interested in including a full version of our software on their CD. To be clear, they weren’t asking about including the demo, something we’re always happy to have spread around. These editors were interested in including a fully licensed, unrestricted version of one of our applications, free of charge.”
