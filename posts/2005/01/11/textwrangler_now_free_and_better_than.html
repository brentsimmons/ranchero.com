<a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/6187">Giles Turnbull</a>: “This announcement by BareBones might be somewhat eclipsed by all the new Apple stuff, but I think it’s important and potentially invaluable to a lot of Mac users. As of now, TextWrangler has been updated to version 2.0, with a bunch of fantastic new features that have only appeared before in BBEdit 8.0. And it’s now free.”
