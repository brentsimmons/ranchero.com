<a href="http://www.niallkennedy.com/blog/archives/2005/01/attentionxml_ex.html">Niall Kennedy</a>: “I wrote an AppleScript that exports all of your NetNewsWire subscribed feeds and followed items within the feed to the Attention.xml format. The output can be saved locally or stored on Technorati’s servers if you have created a Technorati account.”
