<a href="http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/hyatt/archives/2005_04.html#007980">Surfin’ Safari</a>: “The feed URL dialog that tells you 10.4 must be installed to view RSS feeds is simply a bug and not part of a master plan for global domination.”</p>

<p>We assumed as much, but it’s nice to hear it confirmed. The question is: will there be an update for Panther users? (A few other Safari and WebKit bugs have been noted in the 10.3.9 update.)</p>

<p>Despite the bugs, the update has some cool new features. Our favorite may simply be the better performance.
