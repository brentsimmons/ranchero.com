<a href="http://www.coalmarch.com/community.php">Coalmarch Productions</a>: “This script [for NetNewsWire] allows you to subscribe to any number of mailboxes in Mail.app. Its main use is for dropping new unread messages from subscribed news groups (yahoo/apple, etc.) so I don’t have to switch to Mail when I want to be goofing off and reading news.”
