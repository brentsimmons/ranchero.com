<a href="http://arstechnica.com/reviews/os/macosx-10.4.ars/">John Siracusa</a>: “Tiger includes updates that are at least twice as significant as any single past update. Mac OS X is now getting to the point where significant improvements require a larger time investment. As far as the core OS is concerned, most of the low-hanging fruit has been harvested. Now it’s time for Apple to get down to the <i>real</i> work of improving Mac OS X.”
