<a href="http://www.macworld.com/2005/04/features/tigerdashboard/">Macworld</a>: “The concept behind Dashboard is new but straightforward: It’s like an alternate Finder desktop, launched (and later hidden) by pressing F12, containing small mini-applications called widgets. These apps range from calculators, games, and weather reports, but you can also expect to see things like search tools and front-ends for more complex apps.”
