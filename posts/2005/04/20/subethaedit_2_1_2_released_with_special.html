<a href="http://www.codingmonkeys.de/subethaedit/news.html#see212">SubEthaEdit - News</a>: “From today to Friday, 29th of April 2005 we are celebrating the imminent release of Apple’s new operating system ‘Tiger’ and the release of the ‘Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy’ movie, a tale that inspired SubEthaEdit’s name. Hence every customer purchasing a commercial SubEthaEdit license within the celebration period receives one additional license key, that he can give to a fellow carbon based life form or use for his or her second head.”
