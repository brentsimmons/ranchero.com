<a href="http://www.macdevcenter.com/pub/a/mac/2005/04/01/opengl.html">MacDevCenter.com</a>: “When I was in college, I was furnished with a terminal to access the mainframe and used vi and makefiles to develop software. And I liked it! The days of coding on mainframes and PDP-11s may be long gone, but the methodology of software development is still pretty much the same.”
