<a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/AppleApplications/Conceptual/AutomatorConcepts/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001450">Apple</a>: “Apple includes a suite of ready-made actions with Automator, but developers are encouraged to contribute their own actions. You can create actions—which are implemented as loadable bundles—using either AppleScript, Objective-C, or a combination of the two languages.”
