<a href="http://developer.apple.com/business/macmarket/bbedit.html">Apple</a>: “Automation is no stranger to BBEdit itself. Version 8.0 of the product introduced Text Factories, a visual tool for creating a series of transformations on text. Text Factories let you use BBEdit as an automation solution from start to finish. Automator lets you bring multiple applications to the party.”
