<a href="http://developer.apple.com/darwin/cflite.html">Apple Developer Connection</a>: “One of the most powerful yet under-appreciated frameworks in Mac&#160;OS&#160;X is Core Foundation, also known as CF... Because CF is open source, developers can compile and run it on Macintosh as well as other platforms—and this opens up a number of interesting possibilities.”</p>
