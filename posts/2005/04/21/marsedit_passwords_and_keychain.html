The weblog password used by MarsEdit is stored in Keychain so it remains there even if the weblog is deleted. However, you can manually delete it in Keychain Access.</p>

<p>1. Quit MarsEdit if it is running.
<br />2. Launch Keychain Access (Applications/Utilities/Keychain Access)
<br />3. Look for MarsEdit:[your username]
<br />4. You can edit it within Keychain Access or delete this item and then MarsEdit will ask you for a new username/password when you recreate the weblog.
