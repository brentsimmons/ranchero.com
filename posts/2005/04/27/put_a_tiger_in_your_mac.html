<a href="http://www.wired.com/news/mac/0,2125,67334,00.html?tw=wn_story_page_prev2">Wired News</a>: “The feature I’m most jazzed about, and the one that will have the biggest impact on how I interact with information on my Mac, is Spotlight. Spotlight is designed to help users find files—instantly. You type a keyword, and even as you begin to enter the letters, results are already popping up.”
