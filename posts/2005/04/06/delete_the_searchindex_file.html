If you’re using NetNewsWire 2.0b37, and you used earlier betas, then you can delete the SearchIndex file.</p>

<p>It’s probably taking up a few megabytes of space on your hard drive. (Possibly quite a few megabytes.)</p>

<p>Here’s what to do:</p>

<p>1. Make a backup of your NetNewsWire prefs and data. (It’s <i>always</i> a good idea to make backups.) For more about making backups, open the Help book, click on “Contents,” then click on “Backing up your data.”</p>

<p>2. Delete the file at <code>~/Library/Application Support/NetNewsWire/SearchIndex</code></p>

<p>This file is no longer used (as of 2.0b37) so it’s safe to delete.
