<a href="http://www.pcworld.com/reviews/article/0,aid,120281,00.asp">PCWorld.com - Mac Skeptic</a>: “Though NetNewsWire’s interface looks more like that of an e-mail application than a Web browser, it’s easy to get used to its look and start browsing through feeds and news items... If, like me, you have a lot of subscriptions in Bloglines, you can set NetNewsWire 2.0 to monitor these as well.”
