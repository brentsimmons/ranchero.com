<a href="http://daringfireball.net/2005/04/point_counterpoint">Daring Fireball</a>: “The primary group of programmers who were attracted to the old Mac OS were those who wanted to write Mac software: application software and other projects meant for use by regular Mac users. Mac OS X, on the other hand, is attractive to those same programmers, for the same reasons, and also attractive to all sorts of other programmers as well—most especially to those writing software for the web.”
