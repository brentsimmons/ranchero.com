<a href="http://camelbones.sourceforge.net/delta1_0_0b1.php">CamelBones 1.0.0b1</a>: “This new approach is a huge improvement over the old proxy-based bridge, and makes a number of things possible with this new version that could not be done previously: Support for Cocoa Bindings, NSDocument-based applications, Custom NSView subclasses.”
