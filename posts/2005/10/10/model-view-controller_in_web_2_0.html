O’Reilly, <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/8032?CMP=OTC-13IV03560550">Fraser Speirs</a>: “In the Web 2.0 apps that really Get It, they have a database backend, a web frontend and—crucially—some kind of web services API in between. Flickr is a great example of this kind of architecture—almost everything you can do through the Flickr website can be done programmatically through a desktop application.”
