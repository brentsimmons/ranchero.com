<a href="http://www.friday.com/bbum/2005/10/12/advanced-breakpoints/">bbum’s weblog-o-mat</a>: “One very important feature of the advanced breakpoints found within Xcode is the ability to cause something to happen in the debugger—play a sound, print some data, run some AppleScript or invoke a shell script—without interrupting the application being debugged beyond stopping it briefly to take whatever action is specified in the breakpoint.”
