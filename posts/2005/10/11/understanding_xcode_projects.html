<a href="http://developer.apple.com/tools/xcode/xcodeprojects.html">Apple Developer Connection</a>: “To become truly proficient with Xcode, whether you’ve been using it for a while or are just starting to make the transition, an understanding of the Xcode user interface and how it is used to organize a software project is required. This understanding will take you a long way towards understanding the philosophy behind Xcode and how it works, and will help to make it work better for you.”
