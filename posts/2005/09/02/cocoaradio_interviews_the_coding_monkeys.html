<a href="http://www.cocoaradio.com/2005/09/the_coding_monk_1.html">The Story of SubEthaEdit</a>: “It became the ultimate conference collaboration tool and has a large user base today. Powerbook-toting attendees at O’Reilly’s ETCON 2003 made other less fortunate peers green with envy as much of the session notes were written using SubEthaEdit. Grab a copy and soak up their story.”
