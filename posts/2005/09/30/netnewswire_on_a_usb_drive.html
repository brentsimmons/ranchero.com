<a href="http://techgoesboom.com/archives/2005/09/22/netnewswire_on_a_usb_drive.php">Tech Goes Boom</a>: “For those of us who can’t sync our NetNewsWire data over the web due to firewalls or other infonazi roadblocks, there is hope. I currently keep the contents of ~/Library/Application Support/NetNewsWire on my USB thumbdrive. It does slow things down a little bit, but nothing major, and it allows me to keep everything current.”
