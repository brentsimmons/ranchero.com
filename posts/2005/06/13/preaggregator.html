Nick Matsakis: “<a href="http://nick.matsakis.net/software/">Preaggregator</a> is a NetNewsWire add-on that groups together a feed’s unseen stories into a single headline. This is useful for feeds that add a great many headlines at once, but where you are more interested in the the fact that the site has updated than the individual headlines. Preaggregator supports all major feed types, including RSS 2.0 and Atom.”
