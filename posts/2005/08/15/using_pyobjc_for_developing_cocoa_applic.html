<a href="http://developer.apple.com/cocoa/pyobjc.html">Apple Developer Connection</a>: “While Cocoa applications are generally written in Objective-C, Python is a fully capable choice for application development. Python is an interpreted, interactive and object-oriented programming language, that provides higher-level features such as regular expressions and garbage collection, and it&#039;s built into Mac OS X Tiger.”</p>

<p>The <a href="http://rentzsch.com/links/adcPyObjC">follow-up</a> from Jonathan “Wolf” Rentzsch explains that “a lot of tech topics would do better with more cowbell.”
