<a href="http://dmiessler.com/archives/416">Daniel Miessler</a> describes his system for efficiently reading news using an RSS aggregator and a browser with tabs, based on David Allen&#039;s Getting Things Done.</p>

<p>“<i>When you’re opening a myriad of websites and checking each at different times, there’s never an end to it. With this system there is. You check your reliable feeds, open anything of interest, read them all in turn, then <b>you’re done</b></i>.”
