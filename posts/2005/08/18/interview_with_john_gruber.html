<a href="http://www.guidebookgallery.org/articles/interviewwithjohngruber">GUIdebook</a>: “The other thing I remember from the initial Aqua demo was the crazy purple button in the top-right corner of each window. Clicking it would put you in a new ‘single-window mode,’ where you could only see one window at a time. The fact that that feature never saw the light of day is proof that it’s possible to talk Steve Jobs out of a bad idea—that purple button had ‘Jobs’ written all over it.”
