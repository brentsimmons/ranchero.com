<a href="http://homepage.mac.com/brettgross/AppleScripts/AppleScritpts_Random/AppleScritpts_Random.html">Brett Gross</a>: “This little AppleScript will take your currently selected feed from NetNewsWire (paid) and save it to a folder in your Documents folder named &#039;RSS&#039; You can change the destination folder or just make a folder named &#039;RSS&#039; in your Documents folder. </p>

<p>The script will also automatically insert the following keywords in the HTML file: RSS, NetNewsWire, k_RSS, k_NetNewsWire. These keywords can be used as search criteria in Spotlight searches. For example, searching for &#039;k_RSS&#039; will find all of these files no matter where they are.”
