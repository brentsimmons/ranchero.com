<a href="http://ridiculousfish.com/blog/?p=27">ridiculous_fish</a>: “Everyone knows that arrays don’t have logarithmic lookups—they have constant time lookups. But not these ‘arrays!’ (necessarily!) In fact, you might notice that the guarantees Apple does make are weak enough for CFArray to be a hash table or binary tree. Talk about implementation latitude! Is there any payoff?”
