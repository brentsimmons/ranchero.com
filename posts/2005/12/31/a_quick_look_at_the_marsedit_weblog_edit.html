<a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/8891">Derrick Story</a>, O’Reilly: “It sports a clean UI that you’d expect from Ranchero (feeling very NetNewsWire like), is very easy to connect to your MT server, enables roundtrip editing in your favorite text editor (in addition to its own friendly editor interface), has easy-to-use image uploading (uses a separate window that also catalogs your previous image uploads for easy repurposing), includes an RPC console, and is AppleScriptable.”
