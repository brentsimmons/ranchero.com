<a href="http://ollieman.net/?p=68">ollieman.net</a>: “So, as a celebration of just how popular the styles on this site have become I’ve created what is, by far, my best and most complex style yet. It features the elegant, dynamic display of metadata so that it’s there when you need it and not when you don’t.”
