<a href="http://weblog.karelia.com/Watson/Watson_s_Life_Comin.writeback">Dan Wood</a>:&nbsp;“There’s been some discussion on the Watson Users’ email discussion group about the future of Watson and where Sun is going. I am sad to say that it looks like Sun doesn’t seem to be focussing on getting the port of Watson released any time soon.”</p>

<p>This is sad: Watson is cool. But we’re looking forward to hearing what Dan is working on next.
