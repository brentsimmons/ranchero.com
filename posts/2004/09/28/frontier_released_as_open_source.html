Dave Winer: <a href="http://kernel.scripting.com/2004/09/28">Introducing Frontier 10.0a1</a>. “This is a fresh start for the Frontier kernel, the technology under Manila and Radio UserLand, and in the future, possibly many more useful system and network applications.”</p>

<p>No matter what happens next with Frontier, this makes sure that a lot of good work is preserved, which is a cool thing.
