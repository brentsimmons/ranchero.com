<p>Full and Lite versions of NetNewsWire 2.0b6 have been posted to the <a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/beta.php">beta page</a>.</p>

<p>This build fixes some high-priority bugs—including a demo-expiration bug, crashing bugs, and a memory-use bug—and it makes the Find panel work. A bunch of smaller changes were made too, including new style sheets, a new feature for dock menu users, and new feeds in the Sites Drawer.</p>

<p>Read the <a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/changenotes/netnewswire2.0b6.php">change notes</a> to see everything that’s changed since the previous beta.</p>

<p>If a feature you’re waiting for isn’t there yet, or if a bug you reported hasn’t been fixed, worry not—we’re still at work. There will be more betas.
