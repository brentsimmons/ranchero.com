<p>We’ve posted <a href="http://ranchero.com/marsedit/">MarsEdit 1.0b4</a>—here are the <a href="http://ranchero.com/marsedit/changenotes/1.0b4.php">change notes</a>.</p>

<p>The goal of this release was to fix a couple bugs that get reported just about every day: 1) the bug with applying default settings when you choose post-to-weblog in another app, and 2) sending trackbacks.</p>

<p>We recognize that lots of folks are eager for Markdown preview support and for customizing the list of sites to ping. We still plan to do both for 1.0, but they’re not in this beta.
