MacOSXHints: <a href="http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20040929145251144">Post to a Del.icio.us account from NetNewsWire</a>: “Since I do most of my reading in NetNewsWire what I really wanted was the ability to grab headlines while reading in NNW and post them to my del.icio.us account. I created the following AppleScript to do just that.”</p>

<p>Also note that you can set the very cool <a href="http://scifihifi.com/cocoalicious/">Cocoal.icio.us</a> as your weblog editor and post to del.icio.us that way.
