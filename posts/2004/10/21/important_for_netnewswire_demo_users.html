If you’re using a demo version of NetNewsWire, and you think it’s anywhere near expiring—don’t quit the program. There is a bug in the beta where if you quit, then launch it after it’s expired, you could lose your flagged items and read/unread status.</p>

<p>We’re going to release a new beta that fixes this bug tomorrow. In the meantime, please accept our apologies.</p>

<p>You can tell when your demo expires by choosing License... from the NetNewsWire menu.
