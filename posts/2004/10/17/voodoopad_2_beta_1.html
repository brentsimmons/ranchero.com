<a href="http://www.gusmueller.com/blog/archives/2004/10/16.html#1142">Gus Mueller</a>: “I think VoodooPad 2 is ready for some public testing at this point. I’ve been using it for months without any problems, and I’ve had a great group of testers that have pointed out the big flaws which have since then been fixed.”
