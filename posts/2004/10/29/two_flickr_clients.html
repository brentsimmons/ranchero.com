Two weblog editor authors have released Flickr clients. Fraser Speirs’ <a href="http://www.speirs.org/flickrexport/">FlickrExport</a> is an iPhoto plugin that “provides a direct export interface to Flickr.com.” Adriaan Tijsseling’s <a href="http://1001.kung-foo.tv/">1001</a>&nbsp;“not only uploads photos to your Flickr account, it notifies you anytime new photos from either your contacts, everyone, or your favorite tags are uploaded.”
