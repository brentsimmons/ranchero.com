<a href="http://www.scifihifi.com/weblog/software/Cocoal.icio.us-Open-Source.html">Sci-Fi Hi-Fi: Weblog</a>: “Good news for anyone who has ever wished Cocoal.icio.us did X or had Y: now you have the power to make your dreams come true (well, your software-related ones anyway). You heard me right: I finally made good on my promise to clean up the Cocoal.icio.us project and open source the code.”
