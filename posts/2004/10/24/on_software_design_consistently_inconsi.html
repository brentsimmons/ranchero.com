<a href="http://www.advenio.com/weblogs/2004/10/on-software-design-consistently.html">Michael Dupuis</a>: “At first blush, you’d look at these two sets of applications and determine that ‘Aqua apps run to the window edges, and Metal apps have borders.’ But herein lies one of the many inconsistencies. While this is true in general, Apple’s Safari (Metal) throws this paradigm out the window and runs its elements to the window edges. DiskUtility however uses the default Aqua theme and has borders.”
