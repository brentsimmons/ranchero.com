DrunkenBlog: <a href="http://www.drunkenblog.com/drunkenblog-archives/000337.html">RSS for Mac OS X Roundtable</a>: “I’m a big fan of RSS, and while ago I decided I wanted to do one of my chats with the author behind one of the RSS aggregators for Mac OS X, and hit a conundrum: there were too many cool apps to choose from.”</p>

<p>It’s a chat with the authors of NetNewsWire, NewsFire, NewsMac, PulpFiction, and Shrook.
