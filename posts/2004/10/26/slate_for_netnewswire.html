<a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/pftqg/285450.html">Patrick Quinn-Graham</a>: “What with everybody making their own style for NetNewsWire I decided to make my own. It’s nothing revolutionary, borrows from others, but with a colour scheme matching that (basically) of my own site. So nice dark background.”
