One year ago today: "<a href="http://ranchero.com/2003/02/11.php">NetNewsWire 1.0</a> is now shipping!"</p>

<p>Today is the one-year anniversary of the release of NetNewsWire 1.0. It&#039;s been a great first year and we look forward to what the next year will bring! </p>

<p>Thanks to everyone for all your support and encouragement—and look for lots more cool features to come!
