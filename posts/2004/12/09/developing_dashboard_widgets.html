<a href="http://developer.apple.com/macosx/tiger/dashboard.html">Apple Developer Connection</a>: “Widgets are quick to develop and easy to deploy, and they can leverage all of Tiger’s advanced technologies. Widgets are perfect for working with small amounts of data or interacting with other applications, both on your desktop and across the web.”
