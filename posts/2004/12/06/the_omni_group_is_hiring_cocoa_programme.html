The Omni Group: <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/company/jobs/">Want Work?</a>: “Note: we have fish, a cat and a bird in the office, and there are several dogs who spend some time here.”</p>

<p>(No, we at Ranchero aren’t looking for work! But we know a few people in Seattle, or about to be, who might be interested—this is for them.)
