<a href="http://www.malcolmadams.com/itunes/ixarch/arch.php?my=2004-11#111704">Doug</a>: “I&#039;m pleased and excited to announce the debut of Doug&#039;s AppleScripts for iTunes Podcast.”</p>

<p>Also included is an AppleScript script for NetNewsWire for downloading the podcast. (We haven’t tried it yet, but it sounds cool.)
