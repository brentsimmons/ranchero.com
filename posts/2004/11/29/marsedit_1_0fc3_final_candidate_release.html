<p><a href="http://ranchero.com/marsedit/">MarsEdit 1.0fc3</a> is a final candidate release. We’re looking for deal-stopper bugs—bugs so bad that they have to be fixed before shipping this as 1.0. If no deal-stopper bugs are found, we’ll change the version number and make this release 1.0.</p>

<p>There are a few bug fixes since 1.0b12—having to do with drafts, most notably. See the <a href="http://ranchero.com/marsedit/changenotes/1.0fc3.php">change notes</a> for details.
