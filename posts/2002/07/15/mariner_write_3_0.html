Another alternative to Microsoft Word that can open Word files. The problem with Word is that it’s <em>way</em> too expensive. I would have bought it by now otherwise. (Why would I have bought it? Because it’s what other people use. They ask for articles in Word format; they send me stuff in Word format. Ugly but real.)
