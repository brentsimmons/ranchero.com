O’Reilly: “I’ll be facilitating open and frank discussions about sales percentages, servers, coding styles, tools, Web sites, mirrors, sales engines, installers, registrations, support, press releases, marketing, database back-ends, localization. I’ll even come up with a checklist for your first release. Just about everything you’ll need to consider before shipping your product will be discussed right here.”
