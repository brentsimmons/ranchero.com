This final candidate release fixes some bugs and adds a ton of sites to the sites drawer. Check out the <a href="http://ranchero.com/software/netnewswire/changenotes.php">change notes</a>. So now we’re looking for deal-stopper bugs. Are there any bugs important enough that they <em>must</em> be fixed before 1.0 ships? (Remember that of course 1.0 is not the end of the road but the beginning.)
