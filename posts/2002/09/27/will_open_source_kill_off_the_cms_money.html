ZDNet Australia poses an interesting question. Paul Everitt: “My favorite trend is the revenge of the DIYers (do-it-yourself techies). Every time we (the proprietary CMS vendor Everitt once worked for) did a bid, the staff that wrote the existing mod_perl or PHP system was our greatest internal champions. With the tough economic climate, there is sentiment to grow what works, rather than dropping a $1.2 million bomb.”
