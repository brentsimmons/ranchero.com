O’Reilly: “The browser is dead. It’s a two-dimensional piece of software that is slowing the evolution of the Web... [but] contrary to what some people lead you to believe, browsers will be around for a while longer. The purpose of this article is to introduce you to the concept of customizing, or creating, your own browser using the wonderful toolkit that is Mozilla.”
