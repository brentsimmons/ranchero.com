Sun: “The officially supported platforms for Sun ONE Studio are simply those on which the IDE has been extensively tested by Sun’s Quality Assurance teams. The IDE, however, can run successfully on a much wider range of platforms; indeed, it will probably run anywhere that a Java 2 JDK version 1.3 or later is available. One such platform is the popular Apple Macintosh OS X (version 10.1 or later).”
