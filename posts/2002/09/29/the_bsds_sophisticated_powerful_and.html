ExtremeTech on the history of the BSDs: “What is BSD? If you ask a typical computer ‘expert,’ he or she is likely to reply (incorrectly!) that it is ‘an operating system.’ The correct answer, however, is more complex than that. BSD is—among other things—a culture, a philosophy, and a growing collection of software, most (though not all) of which is available for free and with source code.”
