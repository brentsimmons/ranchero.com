Wired: “A few weeks ago, Web designer Patrick Crowley got one of those simple but brilliant ideas that makes you wonder why no one thought of it before. Crowley set up a website called iCalshare.com, a clearinghouse for sharing calendars created with Apple’s new iCal calendaring program, which allows people to publish calendars online.”
