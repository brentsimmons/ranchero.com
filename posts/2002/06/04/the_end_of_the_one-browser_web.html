CodeBitch on Mozilla and AOL: “It will take some time for the users to adopt the new browser; if our stats at MacEdition are anything to go by, there are still a few AOL users using version 4.0 of their client software, so we shouldn’t assume that all AOL subscribers will upgrade at once. But upgrade they will.”
