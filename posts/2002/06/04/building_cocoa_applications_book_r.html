MacCentral reports on O’Reilly’s new book ‘Building Cocoa Applications’ by Michael Mahoney and Simson Garfinkel. I haven’t read the entire book yet, but so far it appears to be more comprehensive than Aaron Hillegass’s book (a book I like very much). How the two books compare otherwise I can’t say yet.
