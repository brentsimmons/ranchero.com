The osxweb mailing list was formed to promote inter-operability between OS X apps that use web services and formats such as XML-RPC, RSS, OPML, and so on. The idea is to create informal standards for things like clipboard formats for RSS items. (The idea is <em>not</em>, for instance, to work on RSS itself.) A secondary goal is to promote a toolbox of code that app developers can use.
