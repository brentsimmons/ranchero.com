This new beta fixes some bugs: links in the HTML view are displayed on mouse-over; a display glitch with the Bandwidth Stats window was fixed; and old-but-still-current items are no longer erroneously marked as unread. (See the <a href="http://ranchero.com/software/netnewswire/changenotes.php">change notes</a> for more info.)
