O’Reilly: “The Apache that ships with Mac OS X is the genuine article. We’re not talking about a weak, proof-of-concept port of Apache that runs under Windows. Mac OS X’s FreeBSD underpinnings allow for the Apache Web server to be as flexible and responsive as it is on any Unix-based operating system.”
