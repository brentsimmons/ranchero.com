I have no idea if it’s true, but it’s an interesting rumor. Spymac reports: “Purportedly, users will have the ability to make their .Mac web page URL redirect to their own computer. If a connection cannot be made (if the computer is turned off, for example) the traditional online version of the site will be displayed from Apple’s servers.”
