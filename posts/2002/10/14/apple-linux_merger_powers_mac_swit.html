Paul Andrews, writing in the Seattle Times: “Macintoshes today use Motorola chips, but the industry is rife with rumors that Apple has developed a prototype Mac running on Intel chips. O’Reilly foresees a world where the Mac operating system could run Linux applications on cheap computers made by Dell, Gateway and Hewlett-Packard (Compaq).”
