Studio Log: “Applescript Studio is the crown jewel of current AppleScript capability. This extension of the Project Builder/Interface Builder IDE allows the use of AppleScript as the programming language for bonafide, powerful applications that can operate on their own and communicate directly with other applications and the shell. Complex interfaces can be created using drawers, tabs, sheets, progress bars, forms, panels and so on.”
