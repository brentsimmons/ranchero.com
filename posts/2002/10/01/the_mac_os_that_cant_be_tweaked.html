Wired News: “By the late 1980s, there were all sorts of Mac GUI enhancements that users could make through shareware and commercial programs: hierarchical menus, tear off menus, enhancements to open/save dialog boxes, sets of interchangeable background patterns and improvements to navigation aids like scroll bars. Apple took the best ideas and added them to the Mac OS. Slowly but surely, dialog boxes were improved, menus were enhanced and windows customized.”
