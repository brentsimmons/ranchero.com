John Welch on AppleScript: “AppleScript is one of the most critical technologies on the Mac platform, yet unlike its positive attitude towards other high profile technologies, like WebObjects, Apple seems to be quite divided on AppleScript (AS). I tend to look at this as ‘Good Apple’ and ‘Bad Apple.’”
