PHP Beginner: “I am going to help you set up Sablotron on PHP so that you are able to parse XML files with XSLT in PHP with the use of Sablotron (A PHP extension for parsing XSLT files). I will walk you through the set up Sablotron and then configuring it with PHP. This allows you to use XML and XSLT together with PHP.”
