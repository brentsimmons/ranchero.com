Apple: “In Jaguar, Sherlock makes it simpler to comprehend that information once you’ve found it. Now Sherlock displays search results in an interface tuned for each channel, instead of launching your Web browser.”</p>\r
\r
<p>As others, including the folks at <a href="http://db.tidbits.com/getbits.acgi?tbart=06816">TidBITS</a>, have pointed out, the new Sherlock looks like a clone of Karelia’s <a href="http://www.karelia.com/watson/">Watson</a>.</p>\r
\r
<p><em>Update 2 p.m.:</em> Some people have suggested that Sherlock 3 actually is Watson in new clothes. It isn’t. See the <a href="http://ranchero.com/?comments=1&postid=205">comments page</a> for this post for a note from Robb Beal clarifying that “Sherlock 3 from Apple is not Watson in any respect. Karelia LLC continues to operate as an independent software development company.”
