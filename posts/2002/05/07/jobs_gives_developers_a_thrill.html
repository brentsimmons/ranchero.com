Wired News: “Apple CEO Steve Jobs presided over an elaborate mock-funeral for OS 9 on Monday, burying the company’s old operating system in a large silver coffin and wishing it well as it enters ‘the bit bucket in the sky.’\r
\r
He then offered programmers at Apple’s Worldwide Developer Conference a ‘sneak peek’ at Jaguar, which is the code-name for the company’s next version of its current operating system, OS X.”
