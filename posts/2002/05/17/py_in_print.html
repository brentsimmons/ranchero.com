ONLamp.com: “When Bryan Richard wrote me a few months ago to ask if I thought a Python magazine would make it, I told him it probably would, if it were a labor of love. I didn’t think he would make much money off the venture, but it would sure be great to have something out there. Maybe it could take off the way The Perl Journal did. Bryan decided it was love, and a few months later, the first issue Py was mailed out to early subscribers.”
