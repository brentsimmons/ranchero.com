Tim O’Reilly’s WWDC keynote: “There have been an amazing number of iBooks at recent O’Reilly conferences. The adoption by key OSS communities and leaders is also striking. For example: most of the Perl core team is now on OS X; James Gosling, Duncan Davidson, and a lot of other key Java developers; P2P developers; many of the key developers in bioinformatics.”
