DevShed: “From the outset Apache was designed so that you can extend it by the addition of ‘modules.’ Modules can do anything you need to do, such as rewrite HTTP requests, restrict access to certain pages, perform database lookups and so on. Modules are normally written in C, which can be hard work. mod_perl is a module which lets you do all of these things, and more, using Perl—which makes the development much quicker than C.”
