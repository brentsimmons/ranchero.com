O’Reilly: “The curriculum for the conference is tailored to programmers, developers, technical staff, and power users who want to master the power of Apple’s state-of-the-art operating system. This four-day event connects Unix experts seeking to adapt their existing knowledge to the Mac platform with traditional Mac gurus who are learning the Unix underpinnings of Mac OS X.”
