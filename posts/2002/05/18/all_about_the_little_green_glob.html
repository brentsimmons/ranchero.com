O’Reilly: Programming with Cocoa: “You all know what I’m talking about: you click on that little emerald glob expecting the window to resize itself to efficiently display the window contents without taking over your screen (we can go to Windows for that). But instead it does something erratic like totally disrespecting the dock, or filling the entire screen to display a small picture.”
