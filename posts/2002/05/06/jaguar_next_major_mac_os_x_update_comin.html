MacCentral: Jaguar will “come with Rendezvous, Apple’s proposed new industry standard for automatic discovery of computers, devices and services on IP (Ethernet, AirPort) networks. In other words, the technology will let Macs automatically recognize other computers on a wired or wireless network and share files with each other or, theoretically, with other digital devices. In his keynote, Jobs demoed streaming music files off of another Mac connected through an AirPort network.”
