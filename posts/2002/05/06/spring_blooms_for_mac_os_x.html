MacCentral: “Spring utilizes the concept of objects as activating various actions. For example, you can have one object in Spring that identifies a specific person—control-click on the person’s icon and choose among various actions like e-mail, instant messaging, view Weblog and check Work Calendar. Likewise, if you need to book a flight with Spring, you simply open a Spring canvas with a background map and click and drag between two spring cities.”
