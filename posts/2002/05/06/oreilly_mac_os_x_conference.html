O’Reilly: “One thing that’s been overwhelmingly clear this year is that the alpha geeks are choosing Mac OS X. Why? Mac OS X is one of the most exciting things happening in the industry today. It’s the confluence of three great traditions—Unix/open source, Java, and the Mac—and the best of all worlds.”</p>\r
