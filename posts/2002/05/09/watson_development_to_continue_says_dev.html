MacCentral: “Dan Wood of Karelia Software, the developer of Watson, confirmed for MacCentral that he had no part in the development of Sherlock 3. Wood also confirmed that Watson is alive and well and he will continue the development of the product.”</p>\r

<p>I’m glad. I don’t know if <a href="http://www.karelia.com/watson/">Watson</a> will continue to be a successful product after Sherlock 3 ships. I hope so. One thing that has always bugged me is how people so often prefer the software made by their OS vendor. Bundling only works so well because people somehow seem to distrust competing apps that come from independent developers, even in the cases where those apps are better and more mature.
