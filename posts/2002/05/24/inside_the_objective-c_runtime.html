O’Reilly: “One reason—yes, there are others—that scripting languages like Perl became so popular for building dynamic Web sites is they are inherently dynamic. Being interpreted (rather than compiled) runtime is ‘compile-time.’ Of course there’s a performance penalty (and the lack of type checking—which some might count as a feature—among other issues) and that’s where compiled dynamic languages like Objective-C come in.”
