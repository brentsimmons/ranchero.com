A List Apart: “You’ve seen them before: links that say ‘click here for printer-friendly version’ or words to that effect. Every time you follow one of those links, you load up a separate document that presents exactly the same information with a different layout, and probably different markup. That means somebody (or a script) had to take the original document and convert it to a stripped-down version that’s more suitable for print output. Maybe that somebody was even you.”
