DevShed: “In the previous article, I’ve shown quite amazing web performance reports from companies that have deployed mod_perl heavily. You might be surprised but you can quite easily get similarly amazing results if you move your service to mod_perl as well. In fact, getting started with mod_perl shouldn’t take you more than 30 minutes, the time it takes to compile and configure the server on a decent machine and get it running.”
