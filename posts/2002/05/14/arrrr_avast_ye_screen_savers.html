MacEdition on writing screen savers in Cocoa for OS X: “Why would anyone want to waste their time writing a screen saver? Because they’re fun! The Instant Gratification Factor is high: You can go from idea to crude implementation in under 15 minutes. Screen savers are also great places to play with drawing and animation APIs.”
