CocoaDevCentral: “The Omni Group has released a few very handy frameworks (if you’re doing networking, anyway). Various smaller companies and even hobbyists have released frameworks and palettes. One of the more complete and ambitious is the $199 (various discounts available in bulk) Application Builder Collection, or ABC, from Jiiva.”
