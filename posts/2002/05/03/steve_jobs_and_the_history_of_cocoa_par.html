O’Reilly: “In this first part of a two-part series, Simson Garfinkel and Michael Mahoney explain why Cocoa and Mac OS X aren’t nearly as revolutionary as they are evolutionary—and still in the process of refinement. The story begins with Apple’s genesis in the 1970s and takes you through key events up through 1993, when NeXTSTEP began to flounder.”
