MacCentral: “CodeWarrior for Mac OS, Version 8 adds support for the Cocoa application environment, an Objective C class library created by Apple that lets developers build native Mac OS X applications. In addition, the new version includes Apple’s Interface Builder, which enables developers to quickly design and build user interfaces for their Cocoa and/or Carbon applications.”
