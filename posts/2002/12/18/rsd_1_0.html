Daniel Berlinger: &#8220;Really Simple Discoverability is a way to help client software find the services needed to read, edit, or &#8216;work with&#8217; weblogging software.&#8221;</p>

<p>Naturally I intend to support this in NetNewsWire Pro, though probably not before the first public beta. I&#8217;ve been pleasantly surprised by how quickly it&#8217;s been adopted by the various weblog systems.
