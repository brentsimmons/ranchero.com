Cocoadev.com: &#8220;This page is for tracking re-usable Cocoa classes that can be mixed, matched, and dropped fairly easily into existing Cocoa projects to add useful functionality. Full application source code is not quite what I&#8217;m looking for here, but rather individual packaged objects that perform a specific task without having too many external dependencies.&#8221;
