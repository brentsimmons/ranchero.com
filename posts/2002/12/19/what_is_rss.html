Mark Pilgrim writes for XML.com: &#8220;It&#8217;s not just for news. Pretty much anything that can be broken down into discrete items can be syndicated via RSS: the &#8216;recent changes&#8217; page of a wiki, a changelog of CVS checkins, even the revision history of a book. Once information about each item is in RSS format, an RSS-aware program can check the feed for changes and react to the changes in an appropriate way.&#8221;
