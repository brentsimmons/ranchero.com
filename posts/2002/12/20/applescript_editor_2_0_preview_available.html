MacCentral posts more about the new Script Editor beta&#8212;including this news: &#8220;Perhaps one of the biggest advances for AppleScript is the ability to control the GUI. The preview release uses a special version of the System Events application to enable AppleScript scripts to select menu items, push buttons, enter text into text fields, and generally control the GUI of most non-Classic applications.&#8221;
