Mac Net Journal interview: &#8220;We emphatically don&#8217;t see files, folders, and apps. We see a hyper-visual rendition of our lifes. Names play a much lesser role. Textual searching supplements visual recall, not conversely. We think of actions (i.e., verbs) like buy, sell, invite, introduce, subscribe, and attend not just move, copy, delete, open.&#8221;
