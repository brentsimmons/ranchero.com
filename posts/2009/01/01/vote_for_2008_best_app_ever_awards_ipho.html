<a href="http://bestappever.com/">Voting is open</a> through January 6 for best iPhone apps. You don’t have to create an account to vote — you can just vote. <strong>So <a href="http://bestappever.com/">go vote</a></strong>.
</p>

NetNewsWire is on the Best Free or Ad Supported App category — but I’m not telling you how to vote. Just saying it’s on the list. :) (Voting is anonymous, of course.)

It was a pleasure casting votes for apps that I know and love.
</p>
<p>
I’m totally looking forward to all the cool stuff to come in 2009. Now that developers have some experience with the platform, things should get even more interesting.
