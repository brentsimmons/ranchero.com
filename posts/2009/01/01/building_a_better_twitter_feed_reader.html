<a href="http://nick.typepad.com/blog/2009/01/building-a-bett.html">Nick Bradbury</a>: “First, URLs are automatically hyperlinked and benefit from the short URL preview feature I mentioned last week.&#160;Author names and @replies are automatically hyperlinked as well so you can click to view that person’s Twitter stream.&#160;I’ve also added hyperlinking of #hashtags — just click to go to a Twitter search page which shows all tweets with that same hashtag.&#160;And since Twitter isn’t meant to be a read-only service, I’ve added a ‘Reply’ icon to enable replying to a specific tweet.”
