Glenn Fleishman, <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2008585647_ptmacc03.html">Seattle Times</a>: “Smaller software developers and service providers have typically found Macworld a great way to reach larger audiences than what they could afford in advertising or direct mail. Developers in the Seattle area... have managed to get a disproportionate amount of attention for bringing great products to the floor, sometimes through booths, but also through informal press and attendee meetings and get-togethers.”
