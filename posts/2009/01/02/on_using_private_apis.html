<a href="http://www.mikeash.com/?page=pyblog/friday-qa-2009-01-02.html">Mike Ash</a>: “One extreme is that private APIs should never be used, period, full stop. They’re bad, don’t want to touch them, don’t even acknowledge that they exist. The other extreme is that they’re fine and dandy, use them like you’d use anything else.”

Me, I’m pretty much in the don’t-use-’em camp. It’s a recipe for heartache. For angry users with pitchforks and weblogs and Twitter accounts.
