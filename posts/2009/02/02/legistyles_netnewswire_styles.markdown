[Antonio Carusone](http://www.legistyles.com/): “LegiStyles™ are a series of custom styles for the award-winning RSS reader NetNewsWire. Much attention has been paid to the design and typography of the styles to improve legibility and readability, and to enhance the overall reading experience.”

My favorite is Haaus.
