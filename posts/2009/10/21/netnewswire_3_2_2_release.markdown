[](http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/changenotes/3.2.x)NetNewsWire 3.2.2 fixes some bugs — most especially that annoying bug where cmd-W would sometimes close the main window instead of the current tab.

You can [download it](http://ranchero.com/downloads/NetNewsWire3.2.2.zip). Also see the [change notes](http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/changenotes/3.2.x) for the rest of the scoop. (There are more things to do — but I felt that there was enough here worth a release rather than holding it up in the lab any further.)

But first, two important notes:

#### Check for Updates may not work

I had to make changes to the updates system. The Check for Updates command may not work — you may have to download this release and install it the old-fashioned way.

But Check for Updates should work fine after that.

#### Introductory pricing will continue till end of month

The first 30 days of introductory pricing is supposed to end this week.

But we decided to push it back until the end of October, since I hadn't posted a reminder recently. This is a reminder, and there will be at least one more when it gets closer. The price will go from $9.95 to $14.95 at the very end of October.

(We’re also pushing back the end of introductory pricing for the [iPhone version](http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=331598976&mt=8) (iTunes link): it will go from $1.99 to $4.99 at the end of October.)
