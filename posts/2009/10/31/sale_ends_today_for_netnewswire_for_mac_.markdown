A quick note about where things stand at the moment:

- NetNewsWire 2.0.2 for iPhone has been [uploaded and is in review](http://ranchero.com/2009/10/29/netnewswire_for_iphone_2_0_2_in_review_). We’re working on 2.0.3.

- The current Mac version is 3.2.3, and we’re working on 3.2.4.

- Longer-term: we’re also working on NetNewsWire 4.0 for Macintosh and a bigger upgrade (version number as yet undecided) for NetNewsWire for iPhone.

Note that the license for the Mac version is a personal license — you can use it on multiple computers, as long as it’s you using it. And the license is good for all 3.2.x *and* all 4.x versions.

Also note: the paid versions remove the ads. (In the lower-left corner in the Mac version, in the table header in the iPhone version.) If you want to continue with ads, that’s fine. It’s totally up to you, of course.

But if you were thinking of buying, please don’t miss out on saving money.
