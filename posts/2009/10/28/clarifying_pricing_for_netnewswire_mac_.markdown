@title Clarifying pricing for NetNewsWire/Mac, plus a reminder
@pubDate 2009-10-28 12:00:00 -0700

I get questions about what you get when you buy a license for NetNewsWire for Macintosh — I hadn’t made it clear. I’ve updated the online store. Here’s the scoop:

- It’s a personal, per-user license. That means if you have a few computers — a desktop and a laptop, for instance, but not limited to that — you can use the same license on each of those computers. (As long as it’s you using it.)

- The license is good for all 3.2.x *and* all 4.x releases.

Reminder: the [price is $9.95](http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/buy) for only a few more days. It will go up to $14.95 at the very beginning of November 1st. If you were thinking of buying it, I don’t want you to miss out on saving $5.

(Note also that [NetNewsWire Premium for iPhone](http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=331598976&mt=8) will also go up in price at the same time, from $1.99 to $4.99.)

#### Where I am right now

I’m working on an update to NetNewsWire for Macintosh — it will be 3.2.4. While I’d like to get it done before the price goes up, that’s not looking likely, since it should spend some time in beta testing first. Next week is more realistic.

A new version (2.0.2) of NetNewsWire for iPhone will go into beta testing today. It fixes some crashing bugs and that confused-navigation bug. Assuming testing goes well, it will get uploaded to the App Store in a couple days, then available once it gets through the review process. (Which takes about a week.)

#### Longer term plans

Work also continues on NetNewsWire 4.0 for Macintosh. This will be a bigger upgrade than 3.2 was, but it’s too early to talk about any other specifics. (Feature requests are always welcome, of course — use the Report Bug or Feature Request command in NetNewsWire’s Help menu.)

And work has started on a bigger upgrade for the iPhone version. I’m not yet sure what the version number will be — 2.1 maybe, or 2.5 or 3.0, depending. (If you buy NetNewsWire for iPhone now, this version, no matter what the version number, will be a free upgrade.) It’s too soon to talk specifics, but I’m pretty excited about it.
