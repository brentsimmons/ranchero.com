kuro5hin: &#8220;Our decades of trying to use [the construction analogy] have not taken us very far considering the incredibly bright minds that have been working on it.  Instead we have to explicitly recognize the true attributes of software creation: its incredible flexibility, its odd economics, and the remarkable human talents required to create it.&#8221;
