Rick Sutcliffe writes, &#8220;The advent of WebLog creation tools, the increasing prominence of XML, and the market appearance of programs such as NetNewsWire make news feeds a personal and individual experience both in the reading and in the writing. Look for a proliferation of sites offering blogs or feeds as this catches on. Ranchero has a big winner here.&#8221;
