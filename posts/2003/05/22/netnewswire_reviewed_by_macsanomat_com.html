Thanks to Lauri Kieksi for the review in Macsanomat.com, the news service of the Finnish Macintosh User Group. NetNewsWire receives 4.5 out of 5 points in this review, written in Finnish.</p>

<p>Lauri says he&#039;s waiting for NetNewsWire to feature a full HTML view&#8212;this is also high on our priority list as soon as WebKit, Safari&#8217;s HTML renderer for Cocoa developers, is released.
