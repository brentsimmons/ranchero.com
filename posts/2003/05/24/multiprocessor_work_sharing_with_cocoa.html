O&#8217;Reilly: &#8220;If your application hasn&#8217;t been written to take full advantage of multithreading, it will not run any faster on two processors than on one. If your code includes any number crunching, you probably should consider how it could be restructured to take full advantage of that second processor, which will otherwise lie dormant, twiddling its thumbs while processor uno works its behind off.&#8221;
