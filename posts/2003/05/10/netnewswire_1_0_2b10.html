This beta fixes a few weblog editor bugs, particularly bugs with editing Blosxom sites. See the <a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/changenotes/netnewswire102.php">change notes</a>.</p>

<p>This should be the last beta to include any code changes. Unless deal-stopper bugs are found, the next release will be 1.0.2fc1, which will include updates to the Sites Drawer and updated documentation, but no more code changes.
