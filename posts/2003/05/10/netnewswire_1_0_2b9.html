This beta fixes one of the most annoying bugs in NetNewsWire&#8212;where headlines that are the same in multiple feeds (as with the BBC feeds, for instance) would mess up various unread counts. See the <a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/changenotes/netnewswire102.php">change notes</a> for more info.
