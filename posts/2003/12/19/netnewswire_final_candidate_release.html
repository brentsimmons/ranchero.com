NetNewsWire and NetNewsWire Lite 1.0.7fc1</a> have been posted to the <a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/beta.php">betas page</a>.</p>

<p>This is a final candidate release: we’re looking for deal-stopper bugs.</p>

<p>This release has just a few changes since the previous beta: most notably, a bug with freshly-downloaded favicons not appearing was fixed. See the <a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/changenotes/netnewswire107.php">change notes</a> for details.
