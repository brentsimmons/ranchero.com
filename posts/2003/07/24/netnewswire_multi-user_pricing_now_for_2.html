We&#039;ve recently changed the multi-user site pricing option for NetNewsWire to require a minimum of two users. If you purchase two or more licenses <a href="https://order.kagi.com/cgi-bin/store.cgi?storeID=2DQ">each license costs $29.95</a>, $10 off the single-user price of $39.95. The previous multi-user site pricing required a minimum of ten users.
