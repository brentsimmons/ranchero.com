Low End Mac has posted a tutorial on creating an RSS feed. It&#8217;s interesting to me because my sites are also built with PHP and MySQL, but my RSS feeds are generated dynamically rather than written to disk and served as static files. I may switch. (By the way, here&#8217;s <a href="http://lowendmac.com/rss.txt">Low End Mac&#8217;s RSS feed</a>.)
