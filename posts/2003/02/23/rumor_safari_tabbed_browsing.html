Perhaps you&#8217;ve seen the rumor (with screen shots) that Safari is getting tabbed browsing. Assuming these rumors are true, my hope is that you&#8217;ll be able to set a pref that says to open URLs in new tabs (when requests come from other apps such as NetNewsWire).</p>

<p>This way I&#8217;ll be able to use NetNewsWire with Safari the same way I use it with Chimera (er, Camino). That is, I read through the news in NetNewsWire, opening URLs as I go&#8212;in the background, in new tabs&#8212;and then I switch over to Chimera.</p>

<p>By the way, I like the name Camino. (The reason why should be obvious, so I won&#8217;t spell it out.)
