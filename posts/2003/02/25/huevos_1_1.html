Huevos is an open source Cocoa app that makes it easy to search lots of different search engines. It comes with 15 search engines built in, and you can add more.</p>

<p>The main change since 1.0 is that you don&#8217;t have to use the mouse at all&#8212;you can bring Huevos to the front via a hotkey, and you can set command keys for your search engines. The up and down arrow keys also navigate through the search engines popup menu.</p>

<p>And so it has a new tagline: &#8221;Search anytime. No mouse required.&#8221;
