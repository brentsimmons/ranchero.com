This release fixes a really annoying bug that appeared in the previous beta. The new headlines and group feeds weren&#8217;t getting updated when they should be. Now they are. Other changes, mostly weblog editing changes, are listed on the <a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/probeta/changenotes.php">change notes</a> page.
