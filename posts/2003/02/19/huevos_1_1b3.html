A new beta of the open source Huevos search application has been released. This beta makes it so you can choose a search engine from the popup menu by setting command keys or using up and down arrow keys. (The point is to make it so you don&#8217;t have to use the mouse.)</p>

<p>The previous beta added a configurable hotkey so you can bring Huevos to the front from within any app. (Not a new feature, but worth mentioning.)
