Tim Bray updated his stats on RSS requests for his site: &#8220;Here are the stats for August 5th, on which ongoing was updated only once: 11,526 GET requests, of which 8,901 returned the no-change (code 304) and 2,625 returned the data (code 200).&#8221;</p>

<p>This is a reminder: one of the best ways to reduce RSS bandwidth on your site is to make sure it supports conditional GET requests.
