Phil Wolff interviews Steve Rose: &#8220;I started playing with the RSS format, creating some feeds for my own personal use, and I thought this would be useful for checking a local University&#8217;s job board. I wrote a quick java servlet to parse the new job listing and return the results as RSS. It was so cool!&#8221;
