A minor update to NetNewsWire 1.0.4 was posted. If you use a proxy server, and NetNewsWire 1.0.4 didn&#8217;t download subscriptions, the new version should work for you.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re already using 1.0.4, and it&#8217;s working fine, then there&#8217;s no need to download this update. We&#8217;d recommend skipping it. It just fixes a special case.
