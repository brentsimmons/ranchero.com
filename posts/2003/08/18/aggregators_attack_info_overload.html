Wired News: &#8220;Maniacally wired netizens who read a hundred blogs a day and just as many news sources are turning to a new breed of software, called newsreaders or aggregators, to help them manage information overload. Many now say that their news aggregator is as indispensable as their e-mail client.&#8221;</p>

<p>Interesting article. I think I was slightly misquoted about sales of NetNewsWire. The &#8220;five figures&#8221; part refers to the number of users of NetNewsWire and NetNewsWire Lite: the number of users is at least a five figure number. Just wanted to clear that up: not a big deal, really.
