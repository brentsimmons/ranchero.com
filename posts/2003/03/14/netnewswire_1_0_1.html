It shipped! The biggest changes since 1.0 are a bunch of crashing bug fixes. See <a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/whatsnew/netnewswire101.php">What&#8217;s New in NetNewsWire 1.0.1</a> for more details.</p>

<p>Now we&#8217;re working on 1.0.2, which will fix more bugs and include new weblog editor features, including support for more Radio and Movable Type options.</p>

<p>Note: the $29.95 introductory pricing for NetNewsWire will continue through March 24. Then it goes up to $39.95.
