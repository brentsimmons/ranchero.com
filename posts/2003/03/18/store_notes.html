<a href="https://order.kagi.com/cgi-bin/store.cgi?storeID=2DQ"><img src="http://ranchero.com/images/nnw/nnw_spring_composite_small.jpg" align="right" height="65" width="77" border="0" /></a>Just FYI: the last day for the <a href="https://order.kagi.com/cgi-bin/store.cgi?storeID=2DQ">NetNewsWire/Spring bundle</a> will be March 24. You can buy both apps together for $39.95.</p>

<p>Also: the introductory pricing for NetNewsWire is good through March 24, then NetNewsWire goes up to $39.95.</p>

<p>So... if you&#8217;re on the fence about it, you still have a few days to decide. We just wanted to make sure the better pricing didn&#8217;t go away without your knowing.
