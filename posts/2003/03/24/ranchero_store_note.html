 Just so you know... This is the last day (March 24) to buy NetNewsWire at its introductory price of $29.95. It will go to its regular price of $39.95 tonight after midnight Pacific time. It&#8217;s also the last day to get the NetNewsWire/Spring bundle: you can get both apps together for just $39.95.
