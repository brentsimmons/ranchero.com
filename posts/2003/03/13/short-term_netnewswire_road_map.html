On inessential.com I just posted a short-term road map for NetNewsWire. Here&#8217;s the condensed version:</p>

<p>NetNewsWire 1.0.1 will probably ship Friday. It&#8217;s mostly about fixing crashing bugs, but there are some other good things in there.</p>

<p>NetNewsWire 1.0.2 will continue with bug fixes and under-the-hood changes&#8212;but I&#8217;m also planning at least a few new features, and I wonder what new features you&#8217;d most like to see.
