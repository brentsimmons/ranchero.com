Feedster is a search engine that indexes RSS feeds. I like it!</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re a Huevos user, you can add it to your search engines list with this search string: <code>http://www.feedster.com/search.php?q=%@</code></p>

<p>And I hope to do some sort of integration with NetNewsWire. It&#8217;s an obvious thing to want to do, I think. One idea is searches that update their results just like any other RSS feed. There are other possibilities, too. (After 1.0.1 ships I&#8217;ll take a look at this.)
