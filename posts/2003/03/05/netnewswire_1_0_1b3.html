Changes include making the XML-RPC and RSS parsers more forgiving of unencoded ampersands, which is one of the most common causes of failures. Downloading categories from Radio UserLand weblogs should work again. (It was broken in a recent beta.) See the <a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/changenotes/netnewswire.php">change notes</a> for more details.
