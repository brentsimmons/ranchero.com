<p>You can buy NetNewsWire and UserCreations <a href="http://www.usercreations.com/spring/">Spring</a> together for just $39.95, a 23% savings.</p>

<p>We&#8217;re happy to offer this bundle, because Spring is so cool, and because we think lots of NetNewsWire users would like Spring and lots of Spring users would like NetNewsWire.
