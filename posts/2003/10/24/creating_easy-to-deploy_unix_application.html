O’Reilly, Mark Roseman: “With OS X’s Unix foundations came the promise of access to thousands of Unix applications for Mac users. But if those applications are hard to install, configure, and use, everyone loses... The good news is that software developers can remove these obstacles for users, often with only small changes to their development practices.”
