<a href="http://www.mikeash.com/?page=pyblog/the-cults-of-programming.html">Mike Ash</a>: “In my experience with various programmers over the years, I’ve realized that most of them fall into one of several cults which describe their behavior. I’ve compiled a list of cults and brief descriptions you can use to identify them.”
