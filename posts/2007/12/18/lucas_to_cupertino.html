<a href="http://wilshipley.com/blog/2007/12/transitions-and-epiphanies.html">Call Me Fishmeal</a>: “First off, Lucas Newman is leaving Delicious Monster—as of January 1 he will be an iPhone engineer. This is an amazing opportunity for him, one I would never ask a friend to pass up.”</p>

<p>Congratulations to Lucas! We’re going to miss him in Seattle, but it gives us another good reason to visit California.
