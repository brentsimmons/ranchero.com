<a href="http://speirs.org/2007/12/05/what-are-xib-files/">Fraser Speirs</a>: “Interface Builder 3 on Leopard introduces a new file format: XIB. The developer experience of editing XIB files in Interface Builder is identical to editing a NIB file but, in many other ways a XIB is radically different from a NIB file.”
