<a href="http://www.seattlexcoders.org/article/32/december-meeting-coreanimation">Seattle Xcoders</a>: “December’s meeting is all about CoreAnimation. Lucas Newman, of Delicious Monster and iPhone hackery fame, is going to show a number of demonstrations and examples of CoreAnimation for us, and how to ‘make it go’.”</p>

<p>Not to be missed. The Woodstock of our time.
