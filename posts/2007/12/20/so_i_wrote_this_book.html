<a href="http://www.atomicwang.org/motherfucker/Index/73277C5E-AF33-492F-8E89-4FB082BA0CED.html">Mike Lee</a>: “I actually had a blast writing the iChat chapter, which was not one of my original chapters, and which I’m not even sure I got paid for. Not to put too fine a point on it, it’s a classic of western literature. It’s got a narrative, character-driven plot, which is to say, it’s full of lemurs.”</p>

<p>Congratulations to Mike on the publication of <a href="http://astore.amazon.com/madagascarfau-20/detail/1590598377/">Mac OS X Leopard: Beyond the Manual</a>!
