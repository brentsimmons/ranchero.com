John C. Welch: <a href="http://www.bynkii.com/archives/2007/12/no_in_fact_i_dont_think_ill_be.html">No, in fact I don’t think I’ll be letting this slide</a>: “While I am normally happy to poke fun at the crazy, the stupid, and the like, there is a level of crazy that even I have the sense to just leave alone, at least under normal circumstances.”
