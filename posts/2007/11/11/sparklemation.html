<a href="http://duncandavidson.com/archives/664">James Duncan Davidson</a>: “The Sparkle framework just nails the process of providing an automatic update mechanism for Cocoa applications... In fact, it works so smoothly that the part of me that automates everything wanted to take it one step further and make pushing a new version of a Cocoa application I’m working on as easy as pushing a button.”
