In an <a href="http://www.austinheller.com/2007/11/interview-daniel-jalkut.html">interview</a>, Daniel says, “I honestly believe we’re on the tip of the iceberg when it comes to desktop blogging. Things are going to change quite a bit over the coming years and as an avid blogger myself, I’m really excited to be able to play a leading role in how things shape up on the Mac.”
