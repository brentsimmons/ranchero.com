ars technica, <a href="http://arstechnica.com/journals/apple.ars/2007/11/02/twitterrific-3-0-goes-commercial-sort-of-with-more-community-features">David Chartier</a>: “Perhaps the coolest of the new features is that direct messages and @replies from other users—whether you’re following them or not—can now appear in-line with all the posts from those you follow (replies appear in orange, direct messages in blue).”</p>

<p>NetNewsWire-related note: the <a href="http://nnwbeta.com/">current beta</a> works with Twitterrific 3.0, but earlier betas don’t. Also, the shortcut for Send to Twitterrific was changed to ctrl-T, so as not to conflict with Spaces. (It was ctrl-1. Oops!)</p>

<p>PS I’m a huge fan of Twitterrific. ;)
