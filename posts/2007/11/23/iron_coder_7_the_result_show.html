<a href="http://arstechnica.com/journals/apple.ars/2007/11/23/ic-7">ars technica</a>: “Another Iron Coder has come and gone, voting is over, results are in, and we have some interesting applications to try. The contest, which this time around had a theme of retro and an API of Core Animation, brought in thirteen entrants, all of which had eight days to work on their entries.”
