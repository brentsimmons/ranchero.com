<a href="http://hivelogic.com/narrative/articles/installing-mysql-on-mac-os-x">Hivelogic</a>: “By rolling our own from source this way, we also have full control over our environment. We know what’s installed and where, what version we’ve used, where it came from, and there’s no dependence on an external ports system and the breakage or issues that come from relying on others to manage our software.”
