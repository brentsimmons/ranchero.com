<a href="http://www.busymac.com/">BusyMac</a>: “BusySync lets you share iCal calendars with family and coworkers on a local area network without a dedicated server and with full read/write access.”</p>

<p>We saw a demo of this at last night’s Xcoders meeting. It’s pretty slick—you set up calendars to share, set read/write access with optional passwords, and then other people on your local area network see your calendars in iCal.</p>
