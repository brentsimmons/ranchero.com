<a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2007/04/04/google-desktop-for-the-mac/">The Unofficial Apple Weblog</a>: “What’s Google Desktop, you ask? It is an application from Google, which indexes the contents of your hard drive (including applications, most files, PDFs, as well as web histories from Safari, Firefox, and Camino) and makes it searchable a la Spotlight.”
