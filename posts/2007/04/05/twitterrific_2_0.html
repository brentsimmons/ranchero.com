<a href="http://iconfactory.com/software/twitterrific/">Iconfactory</a>: “Twitterrific is a fun little application that lets you both read and publish posts or ‘tweets’ to the Twitter community website. The application’s user interface is clean, concise and designed to take up a minimum of real estate on your Mac’s desktop.”</p>

<p>This new version displays tweets inline, which is cool. (I’d bet that it was the most commonly requested feature.) We here in the lab use Twitter <i>because of Twitterrific</i>.
