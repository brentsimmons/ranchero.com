<a href="http://www.sauria.com/blog/2007/04/25/adobe-open-sources-flex/">Ted Leung</a>: “This is a good first step for Adobe, but it’s just the first step. The Flash player is not being open sourced at this time, but when I talked with David he told me that that Adobe had been telegraphing the fact that they were going to open source Flex for about 20 months, since the opening of Adobe Labs.”
