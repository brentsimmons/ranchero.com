<a href="http://www.dashes.com/anil/2007/04/23/cats_can_has_gr">Anil Dash</a>: “The rise of these new subspecies of lolcats are particularly interesting to me because ‘I can has cheezeburger?’ has a fairly consistent grammar. I wasn’t sure this was true until I realized that it’s possible to get cat-speak wrong.”
