<a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/070412/sfth056.html?.v=87">Apple Statement</a>: “While Leopard&#039;s features will be complete by then [WWDC], we cannot deliver the quality release that we and our customers expect from us. We now plan to show our developers a near final version of Leopard at the conference, give them a beta copy to take home so they can do their final testing, and ship Leopard in October.”</p>
