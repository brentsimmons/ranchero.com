<a href="http://gigliwood.com/weblog/Cocoa/ConnectionKit.html">Dan Wood</a>: “Yesterday, I ran across a glowing review of ConnectionKit, the Cocoa open-source framework used for transfer that handles FTP, FTP over SSL, SFTP, .mac, WebDAV, secure WebDAV, the file system, S3, and NNTP. This is a framework that Greg Hulands started quite a while ago, initially for FTP only, but it has grown into an extremely useful and powerful kit!”
