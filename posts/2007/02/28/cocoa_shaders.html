<a href="http://www.kickingbear.com/blog/?p=8">Kickingbear Blog</a>: “Indie Mac Shop has, likely, one maybe two programmers and some contact with a part time artist who may well be on contract. Perhaps they may do the artwork themselves, taking time away from their coding. Either way art, in the indie dev world, is harder to come by than code.” (Via <a href="http://gusmueller.com/blog/">Gus Mueller</a>.)
