<a href="http://webkit.org/blog/?p=93">Surfin’ Safari</a>: “After many discussions with interested parties and members of the WebKit community, we’ve decided the time has come to get serious about stabilizing the code. We’ve had about two years of development, which has included many awesome compatibility fixes, performance improvements, standards compliance enhancements, and new features. Now is the time to get the source tree in solid shape.” (Via email from <a href="http://www.carpeaqua.com">Justin Williams</a>.)
