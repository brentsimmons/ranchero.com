<a href="http://www.friday.com/bbum/2007/02/16/c-portable-macro-assembler/">bbum</a>: “C has always been in the role of the ‘fallback for performance reasons’ solution as soon as developers started writing significant bodies of code in other languages... Even the scripting languages all have supported dynamic loading from the beginning that has always been used for both accessing native functionality and for implementing ‘performance critical’ stuff in native C.”
