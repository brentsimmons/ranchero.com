<a href="http://gigliwood.com/weblog/Cocoa/Leak_Detection_Tests.html">Dan Wood</a>: “Essentially what I thought I’d do is to see how a particular method invocation grew memory over repeated use. That way, leaks would be easy to spot with ObjectAlloc (or probably with OmniObjectMeter).”</p>

<p>Good tip: I’m sure I’ll use it. Here in the lab we use a combination of ‘leaks’ (with stack logging turned on), ObjectAlloc, and MallocDebug.
