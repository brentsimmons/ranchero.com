<a href="http://www.macworld.com/weblogs/editors/2007/02/drm/index.php?lsrc=editorsblog">Macworld: Editors’ Notes</a>: “Steve Jobs may not be exactly reticent, but neither would I call him randomly demonstrative. Rarely do you see him respond to criticisms of Apple, except in the context of interview sound bites. For him to, say, author an open letter on the state of Digital Rights Management is, if not unprecedented, at least very very rare.”
