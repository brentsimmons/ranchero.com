<a href="http://daringfireball.net/2007/02/lies_damned_lies_and_bill_gates">Daring Fireball on Bill Gates</a>, who says: “Nowadays, security guys break the Mac every single day. Every single day, they come out with a total exploit, your machine can be taken over totally. I dare anybody to do that once a <i>month</i> on the Windows machine.”
