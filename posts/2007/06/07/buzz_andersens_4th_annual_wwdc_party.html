<a href="http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/203601/">Buzz</a>: “Come celebrate the start of the Apple Worldwide Developer’s conference, meet the people who make your favorite Mac software, listen to some great music, and enjoy some of the Mission District’s finest tacos, straight off the truck!”</p>

<p>I’m pleased to be able to say that the tacos are on NewsGator. ;)
