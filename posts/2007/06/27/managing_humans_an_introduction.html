<a href="http://www.managinghumans.com/">Managing Humans</a> is a new book by Michael Lopp of <a href="http://www.randsinrepose.com/">Rands in Repose</a> fame. “This book isn’t just about management, it’s about creating places where people can comfortably build stuff. It’s about what to do during the first ninety days of your new gig, and explains why you should pick a fight, because bright people often yell at each other.”
