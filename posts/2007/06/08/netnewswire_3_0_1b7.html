<p>- Smart lists and searching no longer use Spotlight, which wasn’t working for some people. (However, you can still search news items via the system’s Spotlight search.)</p>

<p>- The Combined View is now based on the version that was in 2.x, since that version doesn’t rely on JavaScript and thus doesn’t crash. There is more to do with the Combined View: pagination (for performance) and UI (to make titles easier to read and make it look cooler).</p>

<p>We’re working on other bugs, too—but these are the highest-priority items.
