Iconfactory’s <a href="http://iconfactory.com/software/twitterrific/">Twitterrific 2.1</a> is out. If you have Twitterrific 2.1 installed and NetNewsWire 3.x, then, when you’re reading something cool and you want to tweet it, you can hit ctrl-1 or choose Send to Twitterrific from the News menu.</p>

<p>Then Twitterrific puts some text like “Reading [some page title] at [some page URL]” in the text area, which you can edit (if you want) before posting.</p>

<p>It’s a lot like how the send-to-weblog feature works. (In fact, under the hood, it uses the exact same <a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/developers/externalinterface.php">Apple events interface</a>.)
