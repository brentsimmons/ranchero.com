<a href="http://www.theapplepress.com/?p=196">The Apple Press</a>: “As WWDC comes to a close we went ahead and asked Brent Simmons, creator of NetNewsWire, about his opinions in regards to the iPhone and his reaction to Steve Jobs’ controversial 3rd party application announcement.”</p>

<p>Of course, I want badly to develop for the iPhone, but I understand that things happen in steps, and Apple doesn’t necessarily know this will all end up. So I’m cool with it.
