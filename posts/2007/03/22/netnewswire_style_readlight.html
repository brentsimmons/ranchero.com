<a href="http://cleverdevil.org/article/58/readlight-for-netnewswire">cleverdevil</a>: “For a while now I have been itching to create a custom stylesheet for NetNewsWire, and I finally found the time to do it. So, I am proud to introduce ReadLight—a NetNewsWire style that attempts to feel like reading from a gorgeous hardcover book.”
