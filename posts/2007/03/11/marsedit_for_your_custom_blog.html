<a href="http://www.red-sweater.com/blog/292/marsedit-for-your-custom-blog">Red Sweater</a>: “So how do you get MarsEdit working with your custom server software? You adopt a standard API and implement it for your site, in the form of a ‘xmlrpc.php’ type file that accepts POST requests from MarsEdit and returns the appropriate responses. This isn’t as hard as it sounds, because there are really only a few calls involved.”
