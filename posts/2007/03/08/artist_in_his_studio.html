<a href="http://beta.bigmedium.com/blog/artist-in-his-studio.shtml">Josh Clark</a>: “Exuberance and despair? Jeebus, it’s just software. But I think it’s the nature of creative pursuits that the author experiences the work as soap opera, every day with its allotment of mean drama and glowing victory.”
