<a href="http://daringfireball.net/2007/03/new_text_files_contextual_menu">Daring Fireball</a>: “So I saw this post on TUAW about NuFile, a contextual menu plugin that gives you a shortcut to create new files in the Finder using the contextual menu. I thought that sounded pretty cool, but I’d only ever use it for creating text files. So I wrote an AppleScript for Brent Simmons’s freeware <a href="http://ranchero.com/bigcat/">Big Cat Scripts Plugin</a> that does just that.”
