<a href="http://nick.typepad.com/blog/2007/03/rss_good_practi.html">Nick Bradbury</a>: “RSS auto-discovery links provide a simple way to let feed applications know when your site offers an RSS feed. Although these links weren’t widely used a couple of years ago, today they’re pretty much common practice. However, what isn’t common practice yet is the use of descriptive titles in auto-discovery links.”
