<a href="http://www.sauria.com/blog/2007/08/26/another-victory-for-full-feeds/">Ted Leung</a>: “[If you don’t use full feeds] there’s less chance that I will hit command-control-’ to pop your post’s permalink into Pukka where I can quickly tag it and stick it into del.icio.us, where it can be immortalized as important, seen by my del.icio.us network, and pumped into my blog and tumblog. In other words, you make it hard for people like me to help you.”
