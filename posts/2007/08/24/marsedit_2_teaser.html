<a href="http://www.red-sweater.com/blog/387/marsedit-2s-new-look">Red Sweater</a>: “In addition to some killer new features such as Flickr browsing, ability to add categories and edit slugs, advanced text editor macros, etc., MarsEdit 2.0 also sports a modernized look and feel that I honestly believe will improve your productivity. It’s just super slick.”
