<a href="http://speirs.org/2007/08/19/the-value-of-you/">Fraser Speirs</a>: “My ticket would have cost &pound;2000-2500 instead of the &pound;560 I paid. My lunch partner was having none of this. His response, which I’ll never forget, was along the lines of: ‘Well, how valuable is a meeting with the best minds at your most important business partner?’”
