<a href="http://furbo.org/2007/08/19/mobiletwitterrific/">Craig Hockenberry</a>: “It’s pretty clear that the development of a native Twitter client should be done ‘in the open.’ There’s a lot of reverse engineering involved while developing native iPhone applications, so getting more brains involved will result in much quicker development”
