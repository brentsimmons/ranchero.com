<a href="http://www.ollicle.com/2007/aug/17/nnwstyle_jquery_template.html">Oliver Boermans</a>: “Some of you love the image resizing feature of my NetNewsWire style Ollicle Reflex, but would rather see it in a different style, perhaps one with your own particular CSS tweaks? If this sounds like familiar I’ve made a new NetNewsWire style package especially for you.”
