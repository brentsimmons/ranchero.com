Shawn Blanc <a href="http://shawnblanc.net/2007/the-brent-simmons-interview/">interviewed me</a>. We talk about what I’ve learned in developing NetNewsWire, why I work at home, what I think of Denver, how I delete lots of code, what’s coming up for NetNewsWire, and more. (Plus a bonus picture of part of my office.)
