<a href="http://www.gigliwood.com/weblog/Cocoa/Core_Graphics,_or__.html">Dan Wood</a>: “I’m a big fan of <b>Core Image</b>; I blogged (<a href="http://gigliwood.com/weblog/Cocoa/Core_Image__Practic.html">1</a>, <a href="http://gigliwood.com/weblog/Cocoa/Core_Image,_part_2.html">2</a>) about quite a while ago.  And I like <b>NSImage</b> for its simplicity. But only recently have I been introduced to Core Graphics. I wish I had been aware of its coolness much earlier!”
