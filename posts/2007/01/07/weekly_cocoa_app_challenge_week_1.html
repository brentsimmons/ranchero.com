<a href="http://brok3n.org/archivesextreme/2007/01/the_weekly_coco.html">Chris Forsythe</a>: “For Cocoa I’ve been working on things called ‘stupid apps.’ Basically these are a set of applications that perform 1-2 tasks, help me learn a new thing, and allows me to continue evolving with Cocoa.”</p>

<p>Chris is posting one of these apps a week, and invites anyone learning Cocoa to re-implement the app. When he posts the next app, he’ll post his source code for the previous app.</p>

<p>Pretty cool idea. Here’s the <a href="http://brok3n.org/weeklycocoa.html">summary page</a> for the project.
