<a href="http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,2079624,00.asp?kc=EWRSS03119TX1K0000594">eWeek</a>: “Developers of applications for Apple’s Mac OS X have been watching the Month of Apple Bugs project closely, and are generally in favor of the project’s goal of uncovering OS flaws.</p>

<p>“But they, and security companies, have questions about the MOAB group’s method, which involves making their findings public immediately, instead of first alerting Apple Computer.”
