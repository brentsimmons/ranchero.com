<a href="http://www.gigliwood.com/weblog/Cocoa/LazyWeb_Recruiting_.html">Dan Wood</a>: “I wanted to put out some feelers to see if there is somebody who would be interesting in help out Karelia by doing first-line technical support for Sandvox: reading incoming inquiries, responding if needed, helping users troubleshoot or find the answers in the online help, assigning as bug reports if needed, and so forth.”
