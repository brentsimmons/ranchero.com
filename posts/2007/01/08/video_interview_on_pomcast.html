<a href="http://theocacao.com/document.page/402">Scott Stenvenson</a>: “The Pomcast podcast is doing a series of interviews during Macworld week, and I was asked to do a video interview on Wednesday. The topics range from learning Cocoa, how I got started, what’s coming up in Leopard, living in the valley, and even a bit of Ruby on Rails.”
