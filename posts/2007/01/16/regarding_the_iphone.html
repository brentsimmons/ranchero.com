<a href="http://hivelogic.com/articles/2007/01/14/regarding-the-iphone">Hivelogic</a>: “...there are really three issues that stand out to me right away: the importance of the user interface, the implications of the iPhone for Apple as a company, and the significance (or lack thereof) about the fact that it runs OS X (some people are making a big deal out of this last one, but for all the wrong reasons).”
