<a href="http://wilshipley.com/blog/2007/01/ad-nauseam.html">Wil Shipley</a> on advertising: “And, you’re probably going to forget to bring teh funny in your effort to look all professional, so you’ll just end up alienating your core market of crazy independent thinkers with your attempts to look all sophistomicated. (Remember this is a community where the most remembered ads are a lady smashing a T.V. and ‘It sucks less.’)”
