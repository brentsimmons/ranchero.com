<a href="http://www.sauria.com/blog/2007/01/04/hats-off-to-the-iterm-folks/">Ted Leung</a>: “And boy does it update now. It seems like everytime I start iTerm (which isn’t that often because it’s gotten pretty stable), there’s a new update.”</p>

<p>I’ll have to check it out. I’ve wanted a tabbed terminal (that’s also reasonably fast). I wonder if it has a fullscreen mode.
