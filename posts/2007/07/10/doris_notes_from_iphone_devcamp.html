Dori Smith, <a href="http://www.macworld.com/news/2007/07/10/devcamp/index.php">Macworld</a>: “At iPhone DevCamp, held in San Francisco this past weekend, iPhone owners (and interested non-owners) got together to share their knowledge, brainstorm about future ideas, eat a lot of pizza, and agree that while the iPhone that Apple shipped was an amazing device, the combined brainpower of the attendees could bring it to a whole new level.”
