<a href="http://furbo.org/2007/07/10/bittersweet/">furbo.org</a>: “Both of these key interface elements, navigation and tools, are in fixed locations on the iPhone screen. If you’re trying to develop a ‘sweet’ web application for this device, you’ll quickly find that you can’t follow these standard conventions. That’s because there is no fixed positioning in Safari for the iPhone.”
