Ars Technica: <a href="http://arstechnica.com/reviews/hardware/iphone-review.ars">iPhone in depth</a>: “The iPhone is now out and promises to revolutionize the way we use our phones forever. You don’t have to love it; you don’t even have to like it. You will, however, be witness to a great upheaval in the mobile communications business because of it.”
