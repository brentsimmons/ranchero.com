<a href="http://wilshipley.com/blog/2007/07/iphones-ajax-sdk-no-thank-you.html">Wil Shipley</a>: “What I’m not willing to do is starting programming in AJAX, as Steve so gleefully announced we should do at the (non-nondisclosured) WWDC keynote this year.”</p>

<p>I’ve said before that if Wil didn’t exist, we’d have to invent him. Partly for posts like this one, which say what a bunch of people are thinking—only way funnier.
