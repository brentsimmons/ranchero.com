<a href="http://furbo.org/2007/07/03/the-hig-still-matters-even-with-special-effects/">furbo.org</a>: “The floor displayed on the Dock does not use the perspective of the desk in front of you, nor does it appear as a shelf. Because there’s a difference between the floor angles and the traditional desktop icon angles, many icons look wrong.”
