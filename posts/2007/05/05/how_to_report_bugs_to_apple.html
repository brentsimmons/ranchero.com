<a href="http://theocacao.com/document.page/463">Theocacao</a>: “The Apple Bug Reporter is your single greatest tool in influencing the development of the platform. You don’t need to be an actual programmer to use it, and it’s much more than just a ‘bug reporter.’ It’s a way to provide any kind of structured feedback on Apple software, hardware, documentation, services, or practically anything.”
