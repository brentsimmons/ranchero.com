<a href="http://maczealots.com/tutorials/rubyosa/">MacZealots</a>: “RubyOSA is a bridge from the Ruby language to the Apple Event Manager. The Apple Event Manger allows applications to send and receive messages, or Apple events as they are called, to and from applications that support scripting.”</p>

<p>In other words, you can use Ruby instead of AppleScript. Cool.</p>

<p>Side note: I haven’t looked to see if it’s an actual OSA component or not. It probably doesn’t have to be—because who cares if it compiles and runs in Script Editor or not. But, for anyone interested in OSA components, years ago I posted <a href="http://ranchero.com/software/osashell/">OSAShell</a>, a basic OSA component demo.
