<a href="http://www.crazyapplerumors.com/?p=943">CARS</a>: “While other book series by other ‘authors’ attempt to ‘inform’ you about ‘features’ and ‘ways’ you can use software or hardware ‘products,’ the Take Control of the Missing Manual for Dummies books will encourage you to let your id run amok through a vast technological landscape formed by people who actually do something for a living instead of living in their parents’ basement like you do.”
