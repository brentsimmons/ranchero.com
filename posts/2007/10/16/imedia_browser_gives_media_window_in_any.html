<a href="http://www.macworld.com/news/2007/10/16/imedia/index.php?lsrc=mwrss">Macworld</a>: “Apple includes a media browser in many of its applications, allowing users to browse through photos, songs and movies. iMedia Browser gives users this functionality in any application, according to [Karelia Software].”</p>

<p>Karelia has also made this available as a <a href="http://code.google.com/p/imedia/">framework</a> for other developers to use. (Hint to Daniel—this could be cool for <a href="http://www.red-sweater.com/marsedit/">MarsEdit</a>.)
