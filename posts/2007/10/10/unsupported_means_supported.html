Daring Fireball, <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2007/10/un_in_unsupported">The ‘Un’ in ‘Unsupported’</a>: “I think I finally understand a certain misguided mindset that I’ve been baffled by for a decade. This mindset is exemplified by the sort of person who thinks that Apple ‘screwed them over’ with the release of the iPhone 1.1.1 update.”
