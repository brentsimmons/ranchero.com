Glenn Fleishman, <a href="http://db.tidbits.com/article/9230">TidBITS</a>: “The bits and pieces I&#039;ve heard are maddeningly non-specific: I don’t know, for instance, whether a full software developer’s kit (SDK) will be released; what tier of Apple Developer Connection (ADC) program member you need to be (if any); and how much of the innards would be unleashed.”</p>

<p>Normally I wouldn’t think much about a piece like this—but it’s by Glenn Fleishman and it’s published in TidBITS, so I <i>am</i> thinking that something might be happening.
