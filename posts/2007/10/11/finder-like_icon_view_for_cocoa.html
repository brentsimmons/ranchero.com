<a href="http://theocacao.com/document.page/501">Theocacao</a>: “Mimicking the Finder icon view isn’t entirely easy. Drawing the icons is one thing, but handling drag and drop, repositioning, adjusting the scroll view when the content changes—it all takes some work. To ease the burden, I’d like to share THCanvasView with you.”
