Jacqui Cheng, <a href="http://arstechnica.com/journals/apple.ars/2007/10/12/apple-issues-internal-leopard-gold-master-candidate-builds">ars technica</a>: “Our spider senses are tingling: Leopard’s final release as Gold Master is drawing near. We’ve already seen the OS X 10.5 (Leopard) Gold Master release candidate floating around in the wild today (*cough*), and our sources confirm that a GM candidate build has been released internally at Apple.”
