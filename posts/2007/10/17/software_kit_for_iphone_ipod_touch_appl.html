Glenn Fleishman, <a href="http://db.tidbits.com/article/9247">TidBITS</a>: “While there was no consensus in the existing Mac developer community as to whether Apple would ever fully open up the iPhone platform for third-party applications—a view reinforced by Apple&#039;s early reluctance to make any commitment—Jobs stated quite clearly at the D: All Things Digital conference in May 2007 that Apple would open the iPhone up.”
