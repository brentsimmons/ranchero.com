@title This weblog on hiatus

So I can simplify things for myself and make it more likely I’ll actually post to my weblog, I’ve decided to put this weblog on hiatus and post everything on [inessential.com](https://inessential.com/).

That little bit of friction — answering the question of which weblog to post to — was enough to make posting seem like too much of a chore. So now I don’t have to answer that question.

Hopefully that means I’ll post more often. I’d like to.
