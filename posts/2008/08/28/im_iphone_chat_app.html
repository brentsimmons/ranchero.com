<a href="http://betterelevation.com/2008/08/27/im-plus/">Better Elevation</a>: “IM+ doesn’t appear to be doing any proxying, instead connecting you directly to the server.  This means that when you close the app, your connection is terminated, but the upshot is that none of your login credentials or private conversations are being stored on someone else’s servers.”

Connecting directly to the server is probably a good thing for folks who use chat at work.
