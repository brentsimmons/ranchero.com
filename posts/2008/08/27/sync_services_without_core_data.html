<a href="http://www.cimgf.com/2008/08/27/cocoa-tutorial-sync-services-without-core-data/">Cocoa is My Girlfriend</a>: “If you are using Core Data in a Leopard application then Sync Services is so trivial that you should be syncing if it makes sense. In this article we are going to cover syncing in a non-Core Data situation as that is quite a bit more complex.”
