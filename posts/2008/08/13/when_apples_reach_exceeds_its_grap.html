<a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/134970/2008/08/apple_overwhelmed.html">Macworld</a>: “The public perception of Apple is that it’s a technology juggernaut with immense power at its disposal as it steamrolls over everyone else in the technology industry while creating one industry-busting product after another. There’s just one problem with that image: It’s not true.”
