<a href="http://www.mactips.org/archives/2008/04/12/using-netnewswire-with-your-web-stuff/">MacTips</a>: “One of the greatest things about the greatest RSS reader on the Mac, NetNewsWire, is how many things it can integrate with. It can go hand-in-hand with your blog, your Twitter account, your Del.icio.us account and many others because of its scriptability.”
