<a href="http://www.codingmonkeys.de/portmap/">TheCodingMonkeys</a>: “Some times you want to access your computers at home from anywhere in the world. Be it the web server on your home server, the file sharing on your desktop machine or a remote login to your parent’s computer to support them doing their work. This is where the application ‘Port Map’ might come handy.” (New software from the <a href="http://www.codingmonkeys.de/subethaedit/">SubEthaEdit</a> folks.)</p>

<p>Side note: check out the screenshot and note how iPhone-style On/Off widgets appear in the app. I’ve also seen this in <a href="http://www.equinux.com/us/products/vpntracker/index.html">VPN Tracker</a>. I wonder if we’ll see it in more apps, and if it will become a standard part of the Mac user interface.
