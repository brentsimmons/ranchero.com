<a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2008/04/02/One-Thousand-Followers">Tim Bray</a>: “I enjoy it for the background-conversation-hum effect, sort of like being in a busy coffee shop. And there’ve been a few times when I’ve got professionally-important news way before I would have seen it on another channel, or that I might otherwise not have seen at all.”</p>

<p>I highly recommend <a href="http://iconfactory.com/software/twitterrific">Twitterrific</a>. (I’m on Twitter, cunningly disguised as <a href="http://twitter.com/brentsimmons">brentsimmons</a>.)
