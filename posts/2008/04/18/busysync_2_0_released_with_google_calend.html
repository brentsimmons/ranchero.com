<a href="http://db.tidbits.com/article/9571?rss">TidBITS</a>: “BusyMac released BusySync 2.0 today, an update to its software that synchronizes iCal calendars across systems. The new version’s primary change beyond bug fixes and robustness is the capability to synchronize with Google Calendar.”</p>
