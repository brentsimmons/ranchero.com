<a href="http://www.randsinrepose.com/archives/2008/04/21/saving_seconds.html">Rands in Repose</a>: “Go find the Photoshop guru on your floor and watch him or her work. Yes, the mouse is in play, but did you have any idea how much manipulation he did via the keyboard? Want to know why? Because anyone who has a deep, meaningful relationship with a computer is constantly looking for a way to save a few seconds.”</p>

<p>Which reminds me of <a href="http://inessential.com/?comments=1&postid=3405">something I said</a> parenthetically in a post about managing large Cocoa projects: “Remember, every time you touch the mouse, God kills a kitten. Use the keyboard if you have a heart.”
