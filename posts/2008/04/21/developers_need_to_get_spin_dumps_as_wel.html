<a href="http://www.gigliwood.com/weblog/Cocoa/Developers_need_to_.html">Dan Wood</a>: “It would be much more useful if application-specific spin reports could be put into a user’s home directory, and made readable to that user. Then, third-party developers could cobble together a mechanism for reporting a hang, just like many of us do for crash reports.”
