<a href="http://log.scifihifi.com/post/59360628/ambient-recommendation">Sci-Fi Hi-Fi</a>: “I can think of a lot of other examples of how this sort of casual, ambient recommendation and discovery has worked far better for me than more formal systems designed for those purposes. Music recommendation services have always left me a bit cold, but I love the simple feature of Last.fm that allows me to see what my friends are playing.”
