<a href="http://www.brandonwalkin.com/blog/2008/11/13/introducing-bwtoolkit/">Brandon Walkin</a>: “BWToolkit is a BSD licensed plugin for Interface Builder 3 that contains commonly used UI elements and other useful objects. Using these objects is as simple as dragging them from the library to your canvas or document window.”

Includes “no code” preferences windows, tabbed sheets, transparent controls for HUD windows, button and status bars, and more. Looks good.
