<a href="http://nick.typepad.com/blog/2008/11/favicon-hell-sm.html">Nick Bradbury</a>: “The end result is that it took thousands of lines of code just to display favicons. And that’s often the case with features that seem simple at first glance.”

Nick uses favicons to make a point about software estimates — you don’t know what the weird issues will be until you start writing the code.
