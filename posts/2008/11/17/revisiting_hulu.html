<a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/136833/2008/11/hulu_secondlook.html?lsrc=rss_main">Macworld</a>: “Hulu’s target audience is the increasing number of people who don’t mind the existing model of ad-supported brodcast, but spend more time in front of their computer than in front of their TV.”
