<a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2008/11/12/How-I-Use-OS-X">Tim Bray</a>: “I switched in 2002 and have written probably way too much on my relationship with Apple computers, including one piece grandiosely entitled How To Use Mac OS X. Well, I use one for several hours a day almost every day and while I feel a little humbler now, I still thought it would be worthwhile writing down the practices that serve this particular experienced and intense user well.”
