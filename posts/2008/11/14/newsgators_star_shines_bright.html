<a href="http://www.feld.com/blog/archives/2008/11/newsgators_star.html">Brad Feld</a>: “The extended NewsGator team — including the product folks, sales folks, support, marketing, and executive team — are obsessed with their customers in a way that puts them far ahead of most other software companies.”

I <em>love</em> hearing this. I also love being a part of NewsGator —  I like the people, I like our software, and the work gets more interesting all the time. And the best part is, as Brad says, the obsession with making <em>software for humans</em>.
