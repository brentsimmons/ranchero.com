<a href="http://jeffnolan.com/wp/2008/11/16/satellites/">Jeff Nolan</a>: “For all of the benefits that web-based applications provide, user experience alone is generally not one of them. Small, high performance, persistent desktop apps can intensify usage which can then lead to broader adoption and with mobile apps, specifically the iPhone but eventually more mobile platforms, this goes to a whole new level.”
