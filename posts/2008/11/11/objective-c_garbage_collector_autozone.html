<a href="http://www.friday.com/bbum/2008/11/11/autozone-the-objective-c-garbage-collector/">bbum’s weblog-o-mat</a>: “The source code for AutoZone, the Objective-C Garbage Collector found in Mac OS X Leopard, is now available... The garbage collector is not limited to Objective-C. It is actually a fairly generic scanning, conservative, generational, multi-threaded, language agnostic, collector.”
