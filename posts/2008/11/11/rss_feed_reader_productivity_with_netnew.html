<a href="http://www.didigetthingsdone.com/2008/11/11/netnewswire-iphone-rss-productivity-tip/">DIGTD</a>: “The cool little feature is the ability to choose what feeds you show on the iPhone. Simply, swipe across the feed that you do not want to show on the iPhone and select delete. You now have the option to remove the feed for good, or to just remove it from the iPhone.”
