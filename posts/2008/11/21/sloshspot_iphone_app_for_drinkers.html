<a href="http://mashable.com/2008/11/21/sloshspot/">Mashable</a>: “Sloshspot is an index of bars and nightspots, where users can leave reviews, post photos, and check out other ‘regulars’ of different locales.”

I sometimes wonder if we shouldn’t have a no-technology exception for things like bars. Not on moral grounds but for poetic reasons. If word-of-mouth was good enough for Dylan Thomas and Charles Bukowski, it should be good enough for <em>us</em>.
