<a href="http://arstechnica.com/journals/apple.ars/2008/11/21/in-a-fit-of-irony-iphone-pirating-app-gets-pirated">Ars Technica</a>: “The Hackulous pirating site is dedicated to cracking and distributing iPhone applications without paying any money to their developers. In what can only be described as hilarious irony, a beta version of that application was itself <a href="http://hackulo.us/forums/index.php?showtopic=3522">pirated and released</a> before it could enter a full open-source distribution.”
