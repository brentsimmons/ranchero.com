<a href="http://jeffnolan.com/wp/2008/11/24/network-bailout-or-blow-it-up/">Venture Chronicles</a>: “Lost in the debate about the future of television is the fact that the average American is watching more television than ever, 142 hours per month. Parse those numbers a little more and it’s clear that while Americans are watching a lot of television per month, they are watching less broadcast network television.”
