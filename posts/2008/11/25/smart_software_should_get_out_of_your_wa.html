<a href="http://nick.typepad.com/blog/2008/11/smart-software.html#comments">NickB</a>: “In the semi-perfect world I keep in my head, ‘smart software’ is software that gets the hell out of my way. It doesn’t try to guess what I’m going to do next, doesn’t constantly offer me ‘helpful’ tips, and doesn’t move things around on me in an attempt to suit my needs.”

I know Nick well enough to be frightened — truly, deeply <em>terrified</em> — of the things he keeps around in his head. That mad abyss of mentality, that bog of brains, that swamp of sense, it deranges me, leaves me looking up at the sky, asking the clouds <em>why?</em>, and knowing no answers are possible anymore — there is only the terror.

Except for this. He’s right about software.

PS I’m teasing. Nick’s normal. Really.
