<a href="http://daringfireball.net/2008/11/iphone_likeness">Daring Fireball</a>: “Like the Mac, the iPhone has established UI conventions that aren’t just different, but <em>contrary</em> to the conventions of what has preceded it. Apple has sketched out a remarkably clear picture of what it means for an app to be ‘iPhone-like’.”
