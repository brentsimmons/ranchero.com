<a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2008/11/26/live-mesh-now-available-for-mac-os-x/">TUAW</a>: “Two things about the Live Mesh service that I really like are: (1) You have the ability to sync up to 5 GBs of data. (2) You can access your files anywhere with the Mesh.com website.”

Keeping an open mind is indicated. I’ll check it out. Very cool Mac software can come from unexpected sources sometimes.
