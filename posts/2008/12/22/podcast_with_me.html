<a href="http://www.mobileorchard.com/iphone-development-podcast-5-brent-simmons/">Mobile Orchard</a>: “Brent talks about adapting a desktop app’s UI for iPhone, has advice for indies making a living selling iPhone apps, describes how he successfully split MarsEdit from NetNewsWire, gives some examples of cool iPhone apps, describes his ‘anti-packrat’ compulsion, and chats about the complexity of syncing iPhone and desktop apps.”

I haven’t listened to it yet, so I don’t know if I come across nutty or not — but I’ll elaborate slightly on my anti-packrat thing: it’s a personality flaw. It’s useful, but it’s still a thing I have to deal with, constantly reminding myself <em>no, you can’t throw that out yet</em>.
