<a href="http://speirs.org/2008/12/22/darkslide-15-post-mortem/">Fraser Speirs</a>: “Darkslide was already a fairly complex app and I felt that putting upload into that app would lead to a lot of fumbling around with the UI to get to the camera. Users almost unanimously disagreed with that view, though, and who am I to argue?”
