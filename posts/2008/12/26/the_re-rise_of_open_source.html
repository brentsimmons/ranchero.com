<a href="http://www.feld.com/wp/archives/2008/12/the-re-rise-of-open-source.html">Brad Feld</a>: “Given the range of established open source projects, the opportunity to do this today is much more extensive than it was seven years ago.&#160;In addition, most software companies — especially Internet-related ones — now have robust APIs and/or open source libraries that they actively encourage third parties to work with for free.”
