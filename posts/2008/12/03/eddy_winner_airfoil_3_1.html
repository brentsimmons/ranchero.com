<a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/137276/2008/12/eddyawards_airfoil.html">Macworld</a>: “Rogue Amoeba’s Airfoil unshackles you from iTunes, so you can send audio from any application on your Mac to your remote speakers. With its help, you can watch videos, play games, and even have voice chats with audio streamed to any pair of external speakers — no wires necessary.”
