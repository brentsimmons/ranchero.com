<a href="http://docs.python.org/dev/3.0/whatsnew/3.0.html">docs.python.org</a>: “Python 3.0, also known as ‘Python 3000’ or ‘Py3K’, is the first ever intentionally backwards incompatible Python release. There are more changes than in a typical release, and more that are important for all Python users. Nevertheless, after digesting the changes, you’ll find that Python really hasn’t changed all that much — by and large, we’re mostly fixing well-known annoyances and warts, and removing a lot of old cruft.”
