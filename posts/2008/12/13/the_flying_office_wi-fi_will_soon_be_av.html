Glenn Fleishman, <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/personaltechnology/2008507303_ptairwifi13.html">Seattle Times</a>: “My burning question was simply: can I Twitter? Yes. Also instant message, blog, e-mail, and download files; those around me were streaming video like mad.”

I rely on airplane flights as the one time I’m not connected. I never work on airplanes; I sleep. It’s like a mini-vacation for me. But I understand that people need their digital things all the time these days.
