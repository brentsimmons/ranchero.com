<a href="http://mattgemmell.com/2008/12/08/what-have-you-tried">Matt Legend Gemmell</a>: “The thing is, there’s a disease in the software development world; a sort of sickness. It’s an unusual sickness in that it’s often not something you acquire once you actually join the industry (like greying hair, caffeine addiction and an ulcer), but rather it’s something that new recruits <em>already have</em> when they arrive.”
