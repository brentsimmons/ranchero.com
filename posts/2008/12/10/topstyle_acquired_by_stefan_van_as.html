<a href="http://nick.typepad.com/blog/2008/12/ann-topstyle-ac.html">Nick Bradbury</a>: “I have some good news for TopStyle customers: we’ve reached an agreement with long-time Windows developer Stefan van As to acquire TopStyle, ensuring the future of the product.”

Though you can’t really compare MarsEdit and TopStyle as products (they do different things for different audiences), they were in similar situations. The MarsEdit acquisition by <a href="http://www.red-sweater.com/marsedit/">Red Sweater</a> has worked out wonderfully, and I have every reason to believe <a href="http://svanas.dynip.com:8080/faq.html">Stefan von As’s acquisition of TopStyle</a> will work out as well.

Congrats to all involved!
