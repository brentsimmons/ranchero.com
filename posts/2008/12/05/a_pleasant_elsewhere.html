<a href="http://www.randsinrepose.com/archives/2008/12/05/a_pleasant_elsewhere.html">Rands In Repose</a>: “When I have headache, I read and the headache goes away. When I’m pissed at the world, I find a book and a dark cave and chill in a pleasant elsewhere. Forget about the knowledge and ideas passed along via the written word, reading a book brings a calm to my crazy NADD-driven world.”
