I’ve been using and developing for Apple computers since before there were Macs, and I have no intention of switching. (I’d probably just find another line of work. Beetle-tagging, cloud-counting, feline-persuading, something like that.)

<p>
As much as I adore Apple computers and phones and so on, and as much I like and respect so many Apple employees, it’s also true that Apple <em>the company</em> is a large corporation, and this is how large corporations often are, or try to be. It’s important for us (Mac users, Mac developers) to have no illusions.
