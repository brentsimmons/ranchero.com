<a href="http://www.suntimes.com/business/1336409,ihnatko-apple-macworld-jobs-121708.article">Andy Ihnatko</a>: “So this is a straightforward business decision for Apple. They certainly see this as a Win. They get to do their big product announcements and strategic whoop-de-dos at times and places of their choosing, and in venues that they can control as tightly as Kim Jong Il controls the May Day parade in Pyongyang.”
