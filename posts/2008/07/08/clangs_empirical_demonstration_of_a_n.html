<a href="http://www.gigliwood.com/weblog/Cocoa/Clang_s_Empirical_D.html">Dan Wood</a>: “I ran our codebase (Sandvox, along with the iMedia Browser and other bits of code) through the analyzer, and what I found was very interesting: Most of the bugs that it found, if we had better applied the guidelines we’ve been trying to follow, would not have been there.”

While I don’t agree with every one of Dan’s guidelines, I agree that guidelines and conventions are a good thing. And I’m definitely gonna check out the LLVM/Clang Static Analyzer. (I’m pretty sure Clang is named for a famous Klingon general.)
