<a href="http://blogs.newsgator.com/daily/2008/05/sensearray-filt.html">NewsGator Daily</a>: “Beginning today, NewsGator has enhanced its ability to offer users great stories from feeds that they haven’t seen. We have partnered with Uprizer Labs, whose SenseArray collaborative filtering software is able to provide recommended stories based on users’ own preferences.”
