InformIT, <a href="http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=1220319">Scott Stevenson</a>: “There is, at this point, no better starting point for iPhone development than ‘Cocoa Programming for Mac OS X.’ If you understand the book, you can get started with iPhone development. There are ideas that have changed — for example, controls on the iPhone can have multiple targets and actions — but they have evolved naturally from the ideas of Cocoa programming.”
