<a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/133367/2008/05/magiq.html">Macworld</a>: “The original Comic Life took your photos and let you put them into panels that looked like comic books, complete with captions, dialog bubbles and other effects. Comic Life Magiq builds on that functionality with pre-built templates, ‘props,’ balloons and spraycans to help you tell a story using your own pictures.”</p>

<p>Sounds awesome — congrats to our pals at Plasq!
