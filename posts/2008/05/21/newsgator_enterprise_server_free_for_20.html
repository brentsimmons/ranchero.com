<a href="http://www.rassoc.com/gregr/weblog/2008/05/20/newsgator-enterprise-server-free-for-20-users/">Greg Reinacker</a>: “Why would we do such a crazy thing? We want more people to see it. More feedback. More visibility. This product has been extremely successful — our customer list reads like a who’s who of the Fortune 500 — but it’s been primarily deployed in larger installations.”
