<a href="http://theocacao.com/document.page/571">Theocacao</a>: “The first edition is the one I used to learn Cocoa (back when it was one of maybe two books on the topic), and I remember being struck by how well written it was.”

Like Scott, I learned Cocoa from the first edition. When I recommend Mac programming books, this is the one I recommend first.
