<a href="http://arstechnica.com/journals/apple.ars/2008/05/26/do-not-adjust-your-browser-delicious-library-2-is-out">Ars Technica</a>: “DL2 brings some pretty significant new features and a freshly updated UI. At the top of the list is the ability to catalog far more than just media like DVDs and books; users can now keep track of their gadgets, toys, tools, and just about anything else that Amazon carries. Speaking of media, though, DL2 now also catalogs your entire iTunes library, including music, movies, TV shows, and even audiobooks.”

Congrats to Wil! And to Lucas and Mike, of course, even though they’re not still Monsters.
