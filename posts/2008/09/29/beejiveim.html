<a href="http://betterelevation.com/2008/09/28/beejiveim/">Dave Wiskus</a> continues his look at Jabber clients for iPhone. With BeejiveIM, “Chatting is a thing of beauty. Outgoing messages, as they are typed, are shown in a semi-transparent bubble, giving a clear visual cue when the user is typing, and making the absolute best possible use of screen real estate.”
