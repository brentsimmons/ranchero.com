<a href="http://blogs.oreilly.com/iphone/2008/09/a-bridge-too-far.html">Paul Kafasis</a> on Apple’s rejection of Podcaster from the App Store: “Competition is like a rising tide — it generally lifts all boats. Healthy competition sparks innovation, which helps users, which drives sales. It’s a winning situation for all involved, and that includes Apple.”
