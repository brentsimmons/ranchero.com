<a href="http://theocacao.com/document.page/555">Theocacao</a>: “NanoLife is a simple Core Animation project with a single layer-backed view and a collection of sublayers. Each sublayer has a glowing sphere and moves along a random path, giving the impression of a microscopic lifeforms (<em>or maybe fireflies?</em>)”
