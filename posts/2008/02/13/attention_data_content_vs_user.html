<a href="http://enterpriserss.typepad.com/enterprise_rss/2008/02/attention-data.html">Jeff Nolan</a> (from NewsGator): “Attention data is metadata about what happens to content. At one level it’s as simple as someone clicking on a headline in a feed to open a post, but also included are the actions that people take on content, such as clipping, tagging, bookmarking, and sharing of individual content items.”
