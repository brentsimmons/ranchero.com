<a href="http://www.gusmueller.com/blog/archives/2008/02/acorn_1.1b1.html">Gus Mueller</a>: “What’s new? Lots of things! A web export window, polygon selection tool, ‘trim to edges’ menu command, vector tool improvements, a new crop widget, menu commands to move layers around, a drop shadow filter for bitmap layers, Levels and Auto Levels (yay!), drag images out of the layers list (and into another app such as the Finder or Photoshop. Although I have no idea why you’d want to&#8230;), resize an image via a percentage, option-drag bitmap layers in the canvas and the layers list to duplicate them, a grid, and lots of bug fixes.”
