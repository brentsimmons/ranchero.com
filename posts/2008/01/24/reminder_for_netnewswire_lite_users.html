This is just a reminder for NetNewsWire Lite users: we released the full version of NetNewsWire <a href="http://www.newsgator.com/Individuals/NetNewsWire/">for free</a>. You can upgrade and get all the features of the new version. And all the bug fixes. It’s a better NetNewsWire.</p>

<p>(We noticed a few folks still running Lite in our logs, and we wanted to make sure they got the news about the free upgrade.)
