<a href="http://mooseyard.com/Jens/2008/01/gone-indie/">Jens Alfke</a>: “I’ve left Apple, and I’m now working on my own, from home, as an indie software developer. I have plans for at least two kick-ass Mac apps, I’ll probably contribute to a few open source projects, and I may dabble in some web stuff.”
