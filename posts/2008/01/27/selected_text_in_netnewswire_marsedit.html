<a href="http://www.disruptiveconversations.com/2008/01/using-marsedit.html">Disruptive Conversations</a>: “What’s very cool is that <em>if you select/highlight a block of text before clicking the button</em> you get only that part brought across into MarsEdit. So if there is a paragraph you want to include in your post, simply highlight the paragraph, click the button and you’re off and blogging.”
