<a href="http://shawnblanc.net/2008/transmit/">Shawn Blanc</a>: “And anyone that uses a Mac knows I mean more than, ‘Transmit is an FTP client for the Mac platform.’ Mac users have a high standard for their software. It has to do more than just work; Mac applications have to possess style, class and be enjoyable to use, and work like a charm.”
