<a href="http://www.red-sweater.com/blog/455/marsedit-21">Red Sweater Software</a> has updated our favorite weblog editor: “MarsEdit 2.1 has a new search feature, a new capsule-based tags editor, support for Movable Type tags, support for saving drafts to the server, massively improved preview performance and usability, and a bunch of other performance boosts and feature tweaks.”
