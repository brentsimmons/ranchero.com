Earlier today we released NetNewsWire 3.1—and announced that it, along with other RSS readers from NewsGator, are free. See my <a href="http://inessential.com/?comments=1&postid=3461">post on inessential.com</a> for more info.</p>

<p>There were a couple bugs that weren’t found until after shipping 3.1, so we released a public beta of 3.1.1b1 on <a href="http://nnwbeta.com/">nnwbeta.com</a>.</p>

<p>It fixes a crash-at-startup bug a few people reported, and it fixes a bug where the description view could disappear. (Otherwise 3.1.1b1 is the same as 3.1.)
