Nick Bradbury on the <a href="http://blogs.newsgator.com/newsgator_widget_blog/2008/10/your-customers.html">NewsGator Widget Blog</a>: “One of the more challenging tasks developers face — regardless of whether they develop desktop applications, web applications or even widgets — is designing a feature in a way that not only hides the technical details, but also respects the end user by not asking them to do too much work.”

Nick talks specifically about the tagging user interface in an upcoming version of FeedDemon.
