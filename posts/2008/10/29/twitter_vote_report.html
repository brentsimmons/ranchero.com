<a href="http://mashable.com/2008/10/29/twitter-vote-report/">Mashable</a>: “While substantial efforts are made to get people to actually go to the polls and vote, once they get there, a lot of things can go wrong — broken machines, not showing up in the registered voter rolls, or excessively long lines, just to name a few. Twitter Vote Report is a new mashup that looks to track these problems and use the wisdom of Twitter’s crowd to try and solve them.”
