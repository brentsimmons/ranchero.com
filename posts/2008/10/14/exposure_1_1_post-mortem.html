<a href="http://speirs.org/2008/10/10/exposure-11-post-mortem/">Fraser Speirs</a>: “With some more experience under my belt, I realised that the crushing problem with wireless networking (whether EDGE or 3G) was latency, not bandwidth per se. Doing ‘one request at a time’, particularly for small objects like Flickr’s 75px thumbnails, means that you pay the high time-cost of latency once for every object you load.”
