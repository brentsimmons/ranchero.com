<a href="http://www.mikeash.com/?page=pyblog/the-how-and-why-of-cocoa-initializers.html">Mike Ash</a>: “One of the longest ongoing controversies in the Cocoa community is how to write your init methods. More specifically, how to properly call your superclass’s initializer. In the hopes of putting this controversy to rest, I want to walk through the right way to write an initializer and exactly why this is the right way.”
