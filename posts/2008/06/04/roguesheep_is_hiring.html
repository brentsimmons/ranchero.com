<a href="http://jobs.roguesheep.com/">Jobs at RogueSheep</a>: “More than a specific set of skills, RogueSheep is looking for someone with the right convictions and personality to match with our tightly knit, if quirky team. We need someone that is versatile and willing to learn new skills in old technology and to remap old skills into new technology.”
