Paul Kafasis, <a href="http://blogs.oreilly.com/iphone/2008/06/what-should-iphone-application.html">Inside iPhone</a>: “If you’re not going to be in the store at launch, you can certainly wait and see how the market adjusts itself. Will people pay $10 for applications? Almost certainly. How about $20 or more? We don’t yet know.”
