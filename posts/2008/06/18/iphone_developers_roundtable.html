<a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/134034/2008/06/mwpodcast124.html">Macworld</a>: “The Worldwide Developers Conference is now a recent, bright memory. To celebrate its passing, we devote this episode of the Macworld Podcast to all things WWDC —&#160;a reality check on what Apple announced last week and then a roundtable interview with a group of Mac developers who have turned their attention to the iPhone.”

It was cool to get the chance to talk to Jason Snell and to a couple stars of iPhone development: <a href="http://furbo.org/">Craig Hockenberry</a> and <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/">Greg Titus</a>.
