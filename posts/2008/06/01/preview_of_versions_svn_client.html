<a href="http://theocacao.com/document.page/576">Theocacao</a>: “Versions is the first practical solution I’ve seen for developers — web developers included — who have high standards for UI and don’t have the patience or interest to learn the quirks of the subversion command line tools. For those folks, this is far better solution than making zip copies of your source folders with manual timestamps, particularly when you work within a team.”
