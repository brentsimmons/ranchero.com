<a href="http://arstechnica.com/journals/apple.ars/2008/06/06/mike-lee-talks-tapulous-his-grassroots-iphone-startup">Ars Technica</a>: “Tapulous hopes to show the upcoming swaths of iPhone developers that you don’t have to work for a huge company with a huge budget in order to be successful and create kickass products. ‘I wouldn’t say we’re hoping to lead the community per se, but we definitely want to help build it and shape it into the kind of friendly, respectful, and cooperative environment that the Mac has enjoyed,’ Lee told us.”
