<a href="http://arstechnica.com/journals/apple.ars/2008/06/10/ars-at-wwdc-exclusive-preview-of-mobile-netnewswire">Ars at WWDC</a>: “After yesterday’s exhibition of iPhone third-party applications developed primarily by companies who had never programmed for the Mac before, we here at Ars were champing at the bit to get a peek at a few applications written by grizzled Mac veterans and see how they stacked up.”
