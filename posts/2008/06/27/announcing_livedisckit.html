<a href="http://www.rogueamoeba.com/utm/2008/06/27/announcing-livedisckit/">Rogue Amoeba</a>: “Way back in January, we showed off LiveDisc for Macworld San Francisco. We got a number of requests from other developers looking to use it themselves. At the time we just said ‘maybe’, and then everyone went home from Macworld and proceeded to forget about it.”
