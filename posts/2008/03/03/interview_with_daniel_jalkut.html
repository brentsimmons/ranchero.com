In <a href="http://shawnblanc.net/2008/interview-daniel-jalkut/">Shawn Blanc’s</a> interview, Daniel says: “There is a tendency within Apple to strive for perfection. Nobody laughs at you if you try to make something flawless. This is different from many other software businesses, and was dramatically different from the few little software-related jobs I’d had before.”
