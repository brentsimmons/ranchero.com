<a href="http://www.atomicwang.org/motherfucker/Index/93664D26-DB94-4CA9-94C7-E5639A08B324.html">Mike Lee</a>: “There comes a time when every apprentice must pack up their meager tools and leave their master’s employ. So begins the long road of the journeyman, whose turn it is now to ply their newly learned craft in the hopes that one day they might meet their old master’s eye, a master themselves. For me, that time has come.”
