<a href="http://www.globelogger.com/2008/01/feed-archaeolog.html">Charlie Wood</a>: “Even if Google’s index no longer includes my old posts, I know that NewsGator archives the contents of millions of RSS feeds. So I contacted Greg Reinacker to see how to access that archive, and he pointed me to the NewsGator Archive Service which has most of the data I need and a simple HTTP POST interface I can use from the command line.”
