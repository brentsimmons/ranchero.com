<a href="http://futuremacblog.blogspot.com/2008/03/netnewswire-to-delicious-toread.html">FutureMac</a>: “I’ve modified existing NetNewsWire to Del.icio.us Applescripts to save the currently-selected news item to Del.icio.us with the tag ‘toread.’ You can easily change this tag to whatever tag you use to mark items you wish to read later on.”
