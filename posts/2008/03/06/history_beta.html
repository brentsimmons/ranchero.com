<a href="http://www.atomicwang.org/motherfucker/Index/0F38DBBA-66F1-4D33-9330-CC9A3983E4A6.html">Mike Lee</a>: “As far as the specifics of the announcement itself, I am completely pleased. All the API I was afraid might not be there are there. Integration with Xcode, Interface Builder, and Instruments is more than I could have hoped for.”</p>
