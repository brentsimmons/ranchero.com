Riverfold Software — my friend Manton Reece — just released [Tweet Library](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tweet-library/id365768793?mt=8) (iTunes link) on the iPad.

It's another Twitter client, yes — but it does a bunch that the other ones don't. It archives your tweets and provides filters and collections. Is Twitter important to you? You may need this.

There's a [website](http://riverfold.com/software/tweetlibrary/) that talks more about it — with screenshots and an intro video.

One of the cooler features: you can publish a collection of tweets to [tweetlibrary.com](http://tweetlibrary.com/). Lately I've been thinking about web-based features like that for my own software — so it will be interesting to watch tweetlibrary.com and see how it goes.

Congrats, [Manton](http://twitter.com/manton)!
