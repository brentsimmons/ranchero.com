Somehow I missed this news last week (and maybe you've already seen it) — my friend Patrick Burleson (BitBQ head bit-barbecuer) released [QueueUp](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/queueup/id338142645?mt=8) (iTunes link) on the App Store.

It's an app for quickly adding a movie to your Netflix queue. That's what it does.

I'm not a Netflix subscriber — but, if I was, I'd get this app right away. I love iPhone apps like this, that do a thing, that make it easy to not procrastinate and forget — and that make it fun.
