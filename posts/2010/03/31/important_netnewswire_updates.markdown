Google Reader is about to change their login system. A few days ago we released quick-fix versions of NetNewsWire for Mac and iPhone to work with the new system.

You should make sure you’ve updated.

**Macintosh**: the new version is 3.2.7. You can open NetNewsWire’s About window to check the version.

If you don’t have 3.2.7, you can [download the latest NetNewsWire for Macintosh](http://ranchero.com/downloads/NetNewsWire.zip).

**iPhone and iPod Touch:** the new version is 2.0.3. You can check what version you have by triple-tapping the toolbar at the bottom of the Feeds screen.

You can check to see if there’s an update for NetNewsWire or NetNewsWire Premium by going to the App Store on your iPhone or iPod. Tap the Updates tab. If there’s an update, install it.

**Note:** We have bigger updates of both versions of NetNewsWire coming. These are not those bigger updates — they’re just quick-fixes so that it continues to work with Google Reader.
