I've very much enjoyed the previous 360 iPhone conferences — and the first 360 Mac conference is coming up this December. There's a [call for papers](http://www.360macdev.com/call-for-papers/) — I'll be there, and I'd love to see a great line-up.

One thing that excites me about this is that the Mac doesn't have the restrictions that iOS development has. The Mac is the playground. It's where we get to have *fun*, where we get to try things, where things like [JSTalk](http://jstalk.org/) and [MacRuby](http://www.macruby.org/) appear.

The anarchist in me remains enamoured of the Mac platform, more so than ever, and I'm super-excited for the future of Mac software. The conference could reflect that — with your help.
