In RogueSheep's recent post on [Scholarly Shepherding](http://blog.roguesheep.com/2010/09/24/scholarly-shepherding/), Chris talks about the UW Extension course on Cocoa. Though I'm not one of the teachers, I'm on the board — and I'm hugely proud of the teachers and students and folks at UW who made the first year such a success. Year two is starting soon, and there are still slots open for the eastside class. (Westside is on waiting list.)

Chris also mentions Jake Carter's HTML5 class. (Jake also does a lot of work on the UW class.) While I knew this was coming up, I didn't know it was a [free online-video course](http://training.oreilly.com/html5mobile/) from O'Reilly.

I signed up!

As developers we know that the more well-understood tools we have in our tool belt, the better craftsmen we are.

But the technology world is always uncertain — which tools should I learn? Which languages, which frameworks? How do I stay current? What would be most useful?

You might have trouble picking between [SproutCore](http://www.sproutcore.com/) and [Cappuccino](http://cappuccino.org/), say, or Cocoa and the Android SDK.

But one thing is a no-brainer: you need to know HTML. And HTML5 is the new one, and Jake'll teach it to you. (And it's free.)
