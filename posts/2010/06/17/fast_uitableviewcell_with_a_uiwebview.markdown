[Nick Harris (my co-worker at NewsGator)](http://nickharris.wordpress.com/2010/06/17/fast-uitableviewcell-with-a-uiwebview/): "The problem becomes how you add hyperlinking to a UITableViewCell but keep the scroll speed as fast as possible."

Nick's solution is to actually use a UIWebView. Which works pretty well (to my surprise). He has some demo code posted — and lists a couple issues still to solve. Help appreciated, of course!
