[Jeff LaMarche](http://iphonedevelopment.blogspot.com/2010/06/code-as-if.html): "The other day, I saw somebody wearing a T-shirt that said 'Dance Like Nobody's Watching.' I'm not much of a dancer, but I like the sentiment. However, dancing is not coding. The worst thing you can do is code like nobody's watching."

Jeff makes a great point. I might sum it up as: do it right the first time, no matter what the pressure — it *always* pays off.

(I play a guest role in the addendum. The follow-on point being that code reviews — actually having people look at your code — are good too.)

At WWDC I called Jeff the "smartest guy in iPhone development." If you're a developer, you should subscribe to his feed. (But I bet you already have.)
