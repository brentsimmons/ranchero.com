[Cocoa with Love](http://cocoawithlove.com/2010/06/design-of-every-mac-application.html): "But the classification of an application isn't a simple tree structure — there are many different connections. And the connections aren't simply of heredity — there are subclasses, view hierarchies, event hierarchies, control hierarchies and more."

Sometimes when I just want something good to read I go through the Cocoa with Love archive. I even read articles I've read before.
