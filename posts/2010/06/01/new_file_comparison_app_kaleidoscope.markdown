I use Mercurial these days — and [Kaleidoscope](http://www.kaleidoscopeapp.com/) works with Mercurial. I'll definitely check it out. ([Versions](http://www.versionsapp.com/), also by the Made by Sofa folks, is a great app, which I loved when I was using Subversion.)

Also see [Colin Barrett's blog post about Kaleidoscope](http://iamthewalr.us/blog/2010/06/kaleidoscope-1-0/).
