@pubDate 2010-06-01 12:00:00 -0700

Just a note, because I don’t want you to miss out: the price for [NetNewsWire for iPad](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/netnewswire-for-ipad/id363704172?mt=8) (App Store link) will go up 50% a week from now, from $9.99 (US) to $14.99.

The special introductory price will end — so, if you were thinking of buying it, you should buy it *before* that happens.

Save $5 and buy the [Twitterrific upgrade](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/twitterrific-for-ipad/id359914600?mt=8). Or buy [Bistromath](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bistromath/id309214622?mt=8) or the multiple-award-winning [Postage](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/postage-postcards/id312231322?mt=8).
