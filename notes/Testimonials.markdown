# Customer testimonials

Paul Kafasis:

NetNewsWire was the very first RSS reader I used on Mac OS X, and set the standard. I’m thrilled to be able to use it once again almost two decades later. RSS isn’t dead, and neither is the Mac’s best RSS reader!

Daniel Jalkut:

For 15 years, NetNewsWire has been my primary tool for navigating the broad spectrum of blogs, newspapers, magazines, and other publications that I want to keep up with on the web. I'm so excited to see it revitalized with version 5.0. Here's to 15 more years of NetNewsWire and the open web!

Steve Kirks:

I’ve used different versions of NetNewsWire over the years but this one is my favorite. Like a whiskey that mellows with age, NNW has continued to exceed my expectations. You’ll find delight in the speed of the app, the attention to detail in the interface, but most of all, the freedom to read the web the way you want to from a native application. Crafted by individuals, NNW remains in my “top 10 apps” to install on my Macs."

Brian Warren:

NetNewsWire is back. It feels just as cool and fast as it did in 2003, but not even remotely out of place on a modern Mac. In fact, it’s a shining example of what an app should be on the Mac. It’s lightweight, powerful, and respects my time. I truly do not want to get my news any other way.
