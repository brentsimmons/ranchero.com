# Customer testimonials

Paul Kafasis:

NetNewsWire was the very first RSS reader I used on Mac OS X, and set the standard. I’m thrilled to be able to use it once again almost two decades later. RSS isn’t dead, and neither is the Mac’s best RSS reader!

Daniel Jalkut:

For 15 years, NetNewsWire has been my primary tool for navigating the broad spectrum of blogs, newspapers, magazines, and other publications that I want to keep up with on the web. I'm so excited to see it revitalized with version 5.0. Here's to 15 more years of NetNewsWire and the open web!
