@title Old Versions of NetNewsWire
@description Download old versions of NetNewsWire that run on older versions of macOS.

These old versions of NetNewsWire for Mac are for people running older operating systems.

We canâ€™t offer support for these versions. They surely have bugs, and we donâ€™t even know what the bugs are.

We donâ€™t even know which operating systems work with which apps! Youâ€™re on your own. But hopefully these will be useful to some people. ðŸŽ¸
