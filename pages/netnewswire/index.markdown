@title Open Source RSS Reader for Mac

<b>NetNewsWire 5.0</b> is a free and open source RSS reader for Mac. (We’re also working on an iOS version.)

The Mac version is not quite shipping — it’s in beta — but you can still download it and use it. 

<p class="downloadLink"><a href="https://github.com/brentsimmons/NetNewsWire/releases/download/mac-5.0b5/NetNewsWire5.0b5.zip">Download NetNewsWire 5.0b5 for Mac</a><br />
<span class="systemRequirements">Free! Requires macOS 10.14.4 or newer</span></p>

NetNewsWire shows you articles from your favorite blogs and news sites, and it keeps track of what you’ve read.

If you’ve been going from page to page in your browser looking for new articles to read, you can let NetNewsWire bring them to you instead.

If you’ve been getting your news from the social networking services — with their ads, algorithms, and user tracking — you can get your news from your favorite sites directly and more reliably with NetNewsWire.

We’ll be adding more in future releases, of course, including support for more syncing services.


## Community and Support

NetNewsWire is open source and made by volunteers. We don’t have a dedicated support line. You can email <a href="mailto:brent@ranchero.com">brent@ranchero.com</a>, but this is probably the <i>slowest</i> way to get help.

Your question might be answered on the [Frequently Asked Questions page](https://ranchero.com/netnewswire/frequently-asked-questions). If it’s not answered there, it might be answered in the online [Help book](https://ranchero.com/netnewswire/help/mac/5.0/en/). It’s also possible that it’s one of our [Technotes](https://github.com/brentsimmons/NetNewsWire/tree/master/Technotes).

You should definitely consider joining the <a href="https://netnewswire.slack.com/join/shared_invite/enQtNjM4MDA1MjQzMDkzLTNlNjBhOWVhYzdhYjA4ZWFhMzQ1MTUxYjU0NTE5ZGY0YzYwZWJhNjYwNTNmNTg2NjIwYWY4YzhlYzk5NmU3ZTc">NetNewsWire Slack group</a>. You can ask questions there — and also help us think things through as we talk about future versions. It’s the home of the NetNewsWire community.

You can make feature requests and add bug reports to our <a href="https://github.com/brentsimmons/NetNewsWire/issues">bug tracker on GitHub</a>.

## Contributing

<a href="https://github.com/brentsimmons/NetNewsWire/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md">We welcome contributors!</a> Contributions don’t have to be code. Just getting on the Slack group and talking things over is a contribution.

## Why Write an RSS Reader

We support the open web. The big social networking sites are damaging society and eroding democracy — and we believe one of the ways out of this is to get our news via the open web rather than from Twitter and Facebook.

NetNewsWire is part of repairing <a href="https://anildash.com/2012/12/13/the_web_we_lost/">the web we lost</a>, and it’s part of building the web we want. That future web should not include viral hate speech, abuse, massive corporate surveillance, or succesful influence operations by hostile governments and entities opposed to democracy.

NetNewsWire isn’t <i>the</i> answer — it’s <i>an</i> answer. It’s just a small part of what needs to be done. But it’s the work we personally know how to do, so we do it.

We also love high-quality Mac and iOS apps, and we hope that NetNewsWire will be an example. <a href="https://github.com/brentsimmons/NetNewsWire">The code is available</a> for anyone to learn from and use. We believe it’s one of the largest open source projects written (mostly) in Swift.


## NetNewsWire Users Say Nice Things

Paul Kafasis, CEO, [Rogue Amoeba](https://rogueamoeba.com/):

> NetNewsWire was the very first RSS reader I used on Mac OS X, and set the standard. I’m thrilled to be able to use it once again almost two decades later. RSS isn’t dead, and neither is the Mac’s best RSS reader!

Daniel Jalkut, [MarsEdit](https://red-sweater.com/marsedit/) developer:

> For 15 years, NetNewsWire has been my primary tool for navigating the broad spectrum of blogs, newspapers, magazines, and other publications that I want to keep up with on the web. I’m so excited to see it revitalized with version 5.0. Here’s to 15 more years of NetNewsWire and the open web!
