@title Open Source RSS Reader for Mac

<b>NetNewsWire 5.0</b> is a free and open source feed reader for macOS.

It’s [so basic it’s not even funny](http://inessential.com/2018/12/05/so_basic_its_not_even_funny). By design.

It’s usable, but it’s not actually shipping. It includes syncing via [FeedBin](https://feedbin.com/).

#### To Do

It’s close to reaching the [5.0 beta milestone](https://github.com/brentsimmons/NetNewsWire/milestone/2). Once we have no known bugs and the Help book is written, then it will reach beta.

A few notes about the future:

* We are working on an iOS version, but we will ship the Mac version first.
* We don’t plan on making a for-pay version ever. [This app is written for love](http://inessential.com/2015/06/30/love), not money.
* Future versions will add syncing via [Feedly](https://feedly.com/), [Feed Wrangler](https://feedwrangler.net/), and others, though we make no promises about which ones and when.

#### Technical Notes

NetNewsWire supports <a href="http://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html">RSS</a>, <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4287">Atom</a>, <a href="https://jsonfeed.org/">JSON Feed</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/blob/master/rss-in-json/README.md">RSS-in-JSON</a>.

NetNewsWire requires macOS 10.14.4 or greater.

#### About Using the Code

You’re free to use the code and make your own app, even on iOS. It’s MIT-licensed. Just give us credit and call it something besides NetNewsWire.

In fact, <i>please do</i> use any or all of this code. If you can learn from it — things to do or things *not* to do — then great! Creating a full-featured example Mac app of use to other developers is one of our goals.

Most of the code is written in Swift. Some older parts, particularly in the frameworks, are written in Objective-C. We think this is one of the largest open source Mac apps written mostly in Swift.

#### NetNewsWire History

The app was started in 2002. After a couple acquisitions, [it returned to its original home](http://inessential.com/2018/08/31/netnewswire_comes_home) — right here — on August 31, 2018.

#### Other RSS Readers

If you don’t use NetNewsWire, please consider using some other RSS reader! There are a bunch of good ones.
