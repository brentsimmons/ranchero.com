@title NetNewsWire 5 for iOS Public TestFlight

If youâ€™d like to help test NetNewsWire 5 for iOS, please [sign up on TestFlight](https://testflight.apple.com/join/5Mh4hVpS). (Requires iOS 13. Hopefully youâ€™re on 13.3.)

While the app is close to being finished, there are still some tweaks to make â€”Â and there are bugs, surely. Which is the point of all this. ðŸ˜€

## Feedback

TestFlight includes ways to send bug reports and crash logs â€”Â please use those.

Youâ€™re also encouraged to [join the Slack group](https://ranchero.com/netnewswire/slack). Once youâ€™re in, join the #nnw-ios-feedback channel. This is a great place for questions, observations, and feedback â€”Â and you can get to know other members of the NetNewsWire community.

You can also file bugs and feature requests on our [bug tracker at GitHub](https://github.com/brentsimmons/NetNewsWire/issues). (This is actually quite helpful!)

## Whatâ€™s in the App

The app is for iPhones and iPads. Itâ€™s free and open source, just like the [Mac app](https://ranchero.com/netnewswire/).

The features are similar to the Mac appâ€¦

* Direct feed-downloading
* Syncing via Feedbin
* Share sheet
* Dark Mode
* Starred articles
* All Unread and Today smart feeds
* Folders
* Importing and exporting OPML feed lists
* Multiple accounts
* Background refreshing
* Searching

â€¦and it has a few features that havenâ€™t made it to the Mac app yetâ€¦

* Feedly syncing
* Reader view
* Hiding read articles
* Timeline customization

It also supports Shortcuts! (We love automation. The Mac app is AppleScript-able.)

## Coolest Thing

If youâ€™re using an iPad with a keyboard, you have the same keyboard shortcuts available as in the Mac app. You can fly through your feeds without touching the screen. Itâ€™s awesome!

## Help Book

[The manual is online already!](https://ranchero.com/netnewswire/help/ios/5.0/en/) If you have questions about how to do things, thatâ€™s the first place to look.

You can get to the manual via the Settings screen in the app.

## About the Design

Just as the Mac app is designed to be very much a *Mac* app, sticking closely to platform guidelines and conventions, the iOS app is very much an *iOS* app.

It supports Dark Mode, Context Menus, Dynamic Type, and accessibility. (Bug reports related to accessibility are high priority: if you notice something we can improve, please let us know asap.)

Weâ€™ve worked to make it clear, clean, and as obvious as possible. If it looks like we just kind of skipped the design process â€” if it looks easy, as if it didnâ€™t take much thought â€” then *good*. Thatâ€™s the goal.

## Screenshots

This is a detail from a larger screenshot. See the [Screenshots page](screenshots-ios) for full size screenshots.

## Credits

NetNewsWire is a team.

[Maurice Parker](https://vincode.io/) wrote the entire user interface of the iOS app. Some parts of it [he did twice](https://inessential.com/2019/10/21/swiftui_is_still_the_future), even. Thatâ€™s a *ton* of work. He also did background refreshing, which turned out to be a surprising amount of work too.

[Brent Simmons](https://inessential.com/) designed the iOS app, along with Maurice. Brent wrote much of the under-the-hood parts, and he manages the project.

[Kiel Gillard](https://twitter.com/kielgillard) wrote Feedly syncing, which we prioritized because itâ€™s been the most common of the syncing feature requests. This was tricky because parts of the in-app API were a moving target as he worked on this.

[Nate Weaver](https://github.com/wevah) has been our utility infielder, working here and there to fix different things. When something works a little better, thereâ€™s a good chance itâ€™s Nateâ€™s work.

[Ryan Dotson](https://twitter.com/nostodnayr) wrote the [iOS Help Book](https://ranchero.com/netnewswire/help/ios/5.0/en/). (He also wrote the [Mac Help Book](https://ranchero.com/netnewswire/help/mac/5.0/en/).) This is one of those things itâ€™s easy to skimp on, or just not do, but we consider documentation massively important: itâ€™s a matter of respecting the people who use the app.

The generous folks at [Feedbin](https://feedbin.com/) are hosting the web service we use for NetNewsWireâ€™s new Reader view, and theyâ€™ve gone out of their way to help in many different ways, over and over.

The testers on our Slack group canâ€™t be thanked enough for all their help testing all the early builds â€” and especially for their patience with all the crashes as we were getting background refreshing working.

And, finally â€” [Brad Ellis](https://twitter.com/bradellis) made a beautiful and modern icon for the iOS app. (Brad also made the Mac app icon.) Without a beautiful icon, weâ€™re nothing.
