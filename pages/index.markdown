Brent Simmons has been [blogging](http://inessential.com/) for 20 years. He makes open source Mac apps and lives in sunny, lovely Seattle.


## Apps

Neither of these apps are actually shipping just yet. They’re both free and open source.

**<a href="netnewswire/">NetNewsWire</a>**<br />
RSS reader for Mac. Currently working on 5.0 — but it’s not even in beta yet.

**<a href="https://github.com/brentsimmons/Rainier">Rainier</a>**<br />
Rainier is a free and open source database, scripting system, and development environment for Mac with easy ties to the web. Also not shipping yet. (NetNewsWire is *way* closer.)

## Contacting Brent

You can email Brent — it’s his name (minus last name) at the domain name for this site.

There are two Slack groups: one for NetNewsWire and one for Rainier. If you’re interested in helping out — testing, helping think things over, or even writing code — email Brent and ask for an invitation.

## History

**NetNewsWire**<br />
In 2002, Ranchero Software shipped the first Mac RSS reader written as a Cocoa app. NetNewsWire then changed owners: first NewsGator in 2005, then Black Pixel in 2011. In 2018 [it came back home](http://inessential.com/2018/08/31/netnewswire_comes_home)!

**MarsEdit**<br />
In 2004, Ranchero Software shipped a desktop blog editor that worked with Movable Type, Blogger, WordPress, and other systems. [MarsEdit has been very happy at Red Sweater](https://www.red-sweater.com/marsedit/) since 2007.

**Before the dawn of time**<br />
Ranchero Software was originally formed as World Wide Power & Light in 1995, and changed its name to Ranchero Software in 1996. None of the earliest apps survive — but we sure had fun making them!
