<p>Ranchero Software is a group of volunteers that makes <a href="https://netnewswire.com/">NetNewsWire</a>, a free and open source RSS reader for Mac and iOS.</p>

<p>You can find our <a href="https://github.com/ranchero-software">repositories on GitHub</a>.</p>

<h2>Philosophy</h2>

<p>We believe that the features of popular, lovable apps are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stability</li>
<li>Lack of bugs</li>
<li>Performance</li>
<li>Accessibility</li>
<li>Platform-specific design</li>
</ul>

<p>High quality apps — apps that don’t annoy you with crashes and bugs, that feel light and fast, that fit the platform — are the apps that people love and rely on. And tell their friends about.</p>

<p>We add features slowly and carefully — because the features listed above are more important than any feature we could add.</p>

<p>While the rest of the industry is moving fast and paying little attention to quality, we’re moving slowly and paying all of our attention to quality.</p>

<p>We believe that this is the path to success — and we believe that, now more than ever, it’s also the <i>right</i> thing to do.</p>
