<h2>Philosophy</h2>

<p>We believe that the features of popular, lovable apps are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stability</li>
<li>Lack of bugs</li>
<li>Performance</li>
<li>Accessibility</li>
<li>Platform-specific design</li>
</ul>

<p>High quality apps — apps that don’t annoy you with crashes and bugs, that feel light and fast, that fit in with the platform — are the apps that people love and rely on. And tell their friends about.</p>

<p>Though we do add features to our apps, we do it slowly and carefully — because the features listed above are more important than any feature we could add.</p>

<p>While the rest of the industry is moving fast and paying little attention to quality, we’re moving slowly and paying all of our attention to quality.</p>

<p>And we’re setting out to prove that this is the path to success — and that, now more than ever, it’s also the <i>right</i> thing to do.</p>

<p>Yes. We’re on a mission.</p>

<h2>History</h2>

<p>If you’ve been around a while, you may recall that Ranchero Software used to be a company. It was founded and run by Brent and Sheila Simmons, and it shipped NetNewsWire 1.0 and 2.0 and MarsEdit 1.0. (And some small apps: Big Cat, TigerLaunch, and Huevos.)</p>

<p>A few years ago we decided to <a href="https://inessential.com/2015/06/30/love">write apps for love</a> instead of for money. 😻  So we closed the company and started writing free and open source apps.</p>
